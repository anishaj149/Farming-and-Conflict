Here we go again: The Buttafuocos once more hounded by the Fishers. Or is it the Fishers who are hounded by the Buttafuocos?
With Amy Fisher safely tucked away in jail, her one-time lover, Joey Buttafuoco, claims Fisher's father has assumed the duties of menacing his family.
But Elliot Fisher says it was Buttafuoco who did the threatening.
The two filed criminal harassment complaints Tuesday, accusing each other of making death threats.
No arrests were made. Police said they're investigating.
Buttafuoco won the race to the police station, reporting that Elliot Fisher had harassed him outside his auto body shop.
"I don't need another Fisher with a gun in my life," Buttafuoco said Tuesday.
Elliot Fisher came into the police station about two hours later, claiming that Buttafuoco had spat at him and threatened him and his family.
A source close to the Buttafuoco family said Fisher yelled that he had a shotgun in his car and that he was going to kill Buttafuoco and his family. Fisher used his hand to pretend to shoot Buttafuoco, sai 0 afuoco's wife, Mary Jo, in a love-triangle shooting 1992.
Buttafuoco, 38, was released from jail in March after serving six months for having sex with Fisher when she was under 17.

 Dollar Firms, Key Stock Index Rises for Sixth Trading Day
TOKYO (AP) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose for the sixth consecutive trading day today as a compromise in U.S.-Japan trade talks encouraged investors. The dollar firmed against the yen.
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 41.51 points, or 0.20 percent, closing at 20,663.63. The average now has gained a total of 530.10 points in six trading days, including a 53.41-point gain Tuesday.
The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section was up 2.56 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,658.18. It had gained 1.14 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,655.62 on Tuesday.
An estimated 440 million shares changed hands on the first section, down from Tuesday's 552 million. Advances outnumbered declines 506 to 503, with 173 issues unchanged.
"The accord between the two nations will have a favorable impact on the market, although it may take time to have substantial effect," said Mitsuru Kanno, an analyst with Wako Securities.
The United States and Japan agreed at working-level talks in Washington Tuesday to revive efforts to work out steps to cut the big U.S. deficit in trade with Japan, which reached $ 59 billion last year.
The agreement to resume the trade negotiations, broken off in February, ended a period of increasing acrimony between the world's two largest economies that had shaken financial markets around the globe.
The yen tends to rise with trade tensions because market players believe the United States might push for a higher yen to help cut the trade imbalance. A higher yen tends to make Japan's products more expensive in dollar terms and thus less competitive abroad. It also hurts exporters by reducing the yen value of their dollar earnings, and Japanese officials have worried that it could hurt this nation's recovery from recession.
Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 104.72 yen, up 0.25 yen from Tuesday's close and above its overnight New York finish of 104.65 yen.
After opening at 104.75 yen, it ranged between 104.62 yen and 104.80 yen.
Kazunobu Otsuka, assistant general manager of the treasury department at Sanwa Bank, said the dollar had the momentum to gain further but might not climb back to its level before the trade talks broke off.
On Feb. 10, the dollar closed at 108.25 yen in Tokyo.
The price of the benchmark No. 157 10-year Japanese government bonds closed at 105.13 yen, down 0.11 yen from Tuesday's close. Their yield rose to 3.740 percent from 3.725 percent.
