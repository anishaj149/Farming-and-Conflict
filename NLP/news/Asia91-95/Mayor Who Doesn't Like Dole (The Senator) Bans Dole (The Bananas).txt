A Turkish mayor who doesn't like Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole banned the sale of Dole bananas in his town, claiming Friday that the senator owns the fruit company.
Turks accuse Sen. Dole, R-Kan., of being anti-Turkish and blame him for an attempt in Congress to deny American aid to Turkey for refusing to allow relief supplies for Armenian refugees to pass through the country.
Mayor Burhanettin Ozfatura of this Aegean coast town claimed that Dole is the owner of the banana company, the private television channel Kanal D reported. His order covers several town-owned grocery stores, and it wasn't clear whether it would affect private stores.
Dole Food Co., based in Westlake Village, Calif., has no connection to the Senate majority leader, said company spokesman Tom Pernice. Company founder James Dole, who died in 1972, was no relation to the senator.
