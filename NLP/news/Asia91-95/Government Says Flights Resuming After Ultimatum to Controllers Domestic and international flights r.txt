The strike stranded more than 10,000 passengers at Philippine airports and those throughout Southeast Asia who were waiting for flights to the Philippines.
On Sunday, Gerardo Protacio, assistant director of the Air Transportation Office, said controllers were served back-to-work orders late Saturday and that at least nine strike leaders had been suspended for refusing to comply.
It was unclear how many controllers had actually reported for work as of Sunday. On Saturday, Francis Tolentino, a spokesman for the Philippine Air Traffic Controllers Association, said most of the country's 370 air traffic controllers had joined the strike.
Tolentino said the controllers want permission to form a private company so their wages can be increased beyond a ceiling imposed on government employees.
