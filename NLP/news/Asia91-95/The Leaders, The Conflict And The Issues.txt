A look at the Jordanian and Israeli leaders, the conflict that has pitted their countries against each other for nearly half a century and the issues their negotiators must settle to reach a peace agreement:

THE LEADERS AND THE CONFLICT:
-King Hussein of Jordan: He ascended to the throne in 1953 and has survived the tempests of Middle East politics and numerous assassination attempts. Hussein, 58, rode out the Arabs' 1967 defeat by Israel that cost him the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Through much of his reign Hussein, alone among Arab rulers, conducted secret talks with Israeli leaders. Like nearly all other Arab leaders, he opposed the 1979 Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. But in the years that followed, he pushed further than any other Arab leader in exploring U.S. efforts to mediate a broader Arab-Israeli peace.
-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel: Rabin, 72, has swung between winning wars and forging peace since before Israel's founding in 1948. A former Jewish underground leader, he was military commander in the 1967 war. The Labor Party chose him to lead Israel after the debacle of the 1973 war. He was forced to resign in 1977 over a scandal involving an illegal U.S. bank account kept by his wife. The hard-line, right-wing Likud bloc took power and he was defense chief in national unity governments from 1984 to 1990. He replaced Shimon Peres as Labor leader and later led the party back to power.

THE ISSUES ON THE NEGOTIATING TABLE:
-Borders and Security: The two sides want to demarcate their 400 miles of mostly desert borders. Both sides want tighter security to prevent infiltrations and smuggling.
-Territory: Jordan is demanding the return of 152 square miles of territory it claims Israel has usurped since 1948.
-Water: Jordan is demanding that Israel respect tacit agreements reached in the 1950s setting out shares of the waters of the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers. It says Israel is diverting the waters upstream, depriving the kingdom of more than half its share.
