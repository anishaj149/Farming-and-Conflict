In November, the U.N. experts went to Iraq to determine how to destroy the weapons. They asked the Iraqis to build the basic structure of the plant, something that could cost about half a million dollars, said Ronald Manley, the leader of the team that went in Sunday.
The team will leave April 13.
Manley, a Briton, said the destruction process began with the collection of chemical weapons and stocks of chemical agents at Muthana, the main such facility on the outskirts of Baghdad.
It was heavily bombed by coalition warplanes during the Persian Gulf War.
Manley said there were about 40,000 leaking chemical-filled rocket warheads, artillery shells and bombs at Muthana.
The second phase in their destruction is removing the chemicals from the weapons, a process which the Iraqis also are doing under U.N. supervision, expected to be completed by June.
The last phase will be the destruction of the agents.
