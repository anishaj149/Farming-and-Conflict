A brief look at the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
---
THE GAZA STRIP
The crowded refugee camps of the 140-square-mile strip along the Mediterranean spawn the most attacks against Israeli rule in the occupied lands.
More than 70 percent of Gazans are Palestinian refugees, and Hamas, the fundamentalist Islamic organization that is the PLO's main opposition, is strongest in Gaza.
About 4,000 Jewish settlers live south of the strip. Their leaders have vowed not to leave, but privately many settlers say they want to leave because of repeated attacks. Most Israelis have also say they would be happy to let the strip go.

JERICHO
An oasis with palm-lined streets six miles from the Jordan river, Jericho represents a tranquil ideal to Palestinians and Israelis.
The West Bank town of 10,000, famous for its cafes and restaurants, is important to the Palestinians because of its proximity to the Allenby Bridge, the major border crossing into Jordan, whose population is more than 50 percent Palestinian.
Palestinian residents and Jewish settlers in the area are secular moderates who back compromise. Jericho lacks the political activism of cities like Nablus and Ramallah, West Bank centers of the uprising.
