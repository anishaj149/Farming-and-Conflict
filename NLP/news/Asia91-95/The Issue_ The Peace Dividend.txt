Here are the views of the major presidential candidates on the question: "What should be the top federal spending priority for any money derived from a 'peace dividend' reduction in defense spending?"
 
 DEMOCRATS
-Jerry Brown: A spokeswoman said Brown's priority would be the infrastructure, building a high-speed rail system and developing ports for international trade.
 
 -Bill Clinton: A spokesman said Clinton's top priority would be investing the money in "a national economic strategy to promote American competitiveness, create incentives for new jobs and new businesses and greatly improve worker training."
 
 -Tom Harkin: "The peace dividend should be used to get America working. My plan would save $ 420 billion over a 10-year period. One-third of that would go to reducing our national debt - the remaining amount would be reinvested in America. We would use the funds for rebuilding America, investing in high-technology and bio-technology industries and building roads, schools and research labs."
-Bob Kerrey: "We must invest these savings in the things that boost productivity and improve living standards. We need investments in our people - national health insurance, innovative schools, worker training programs; our industry - a civilian research agency, tax credits for investment and research; and our foundation - highways and mass transit, a communications infrastructure."
 
 -Paul Tsongas: "Money that is saved through defense cuts should be used to reduce our debt, to help stimulate investment in emerging new industries and to fund research which will restore our technological and scientific leadership. Though there are many worthwhile uses for these funds, the way to ensure jobs, and to make sure our social needs are met, is to invest in rebuilding the industrial base of our economy."
 
 REPUBLICANS
-George Bush: The Bush administration initially said the surplus would go to help reduce the budget deficit, but President Bush indicated in his 1993 budget that he would be willing to discuss how to spend it with Congress. "Frankly, I'd like to put it into the pockets of the American taxpayer, if I possibly could," he told reporters in Singapore.
 
 -Patrick Buchanan: "Depending on the amount, any significant savings from defense reductions could be used to reduce the deficit, or returned to the taxpayer. The 'peace dividend' must not be used as an excuse for increased federal spending."
 
 -David Duke: "Rebuilding our infrastructure and educating our children."
