Fifteen rain forest "hot spots" that cover less than 1 percent of the Earth's land surface are overflowing with one-third of all terrestrial plant and animal species, Conservation International says.
These areas also are among the most immediately endangered wildernesses in the world, with the threat of logging, farming or ranching at their doorsteps, said Russell Mittermeier, the group's president.
The biodiversity convention, or treaty, being prepared for the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June will help protect these areas, but only if it is followed by action on the ground, Mittermeier said.
"The very fact that you have a convention elevates biodiversity to the status of global warming, which it certainly deserves," he said. "But the real issue is follow-up and development of action plans on a country-by-country basis."
The fifteen hot spots identified in a new report from the group are:
- In Latin America, the Chocoan forest of Colombia and Ecuador; the Atlantic forest of Brazil; the tropical slopes of the Andes; and the forests of Mexico and Central America.
- In Africa, the upper Guinean forests of West Africa; the eastern arc mountains of Tanzania; and Madagascar.
- In Asia, the western Ghats of India; the eastern Himalayas; and the Sinharaja forest of Sri Lanka.
- Scattered around Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, Indonesia; the Philippines; peninsular Malaysia; northern Borneo; and Melanesia.
The report also found that more than half of the world's land area has been changed from its natural state and that areas with the densest concentrations of species - that is, with the greatest biodiversity - have been significantly altered.
