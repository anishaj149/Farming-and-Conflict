The two Americans imprisoned for illegal entry into Iraq "simply took the wrong fork in the road" as they were attempting to visit a friend at a U.N. camp in Kuwait, the State Department said Thursday.
When David Daliberti and William Barloon, both civilian mechanics, became aware of their mistake, they were immediately surrounded by Iraqi border police, State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said.
They intended to go to a U.N. compound in Kuwait but, instead, they took the road leading to Umm Qasr in Iraq, she said.
Guards at a U.N. checkpoint near the border thought their white Pajero was a U.N. vehicle, Shelley said, and the Americans were waved on.
"Approximately 60 meters beyond the border is a kiosk at the Iraqi border checkpoint," she added. "Although Iraqi border police monitor border traffic, they did not stop Daliberti and Barloon."
It was shortly after they passed the kiosk on March 13 that they were arrested, taken to taken to headquarters and told they were under arrest for crossing the border illegally.
Shelly said the two had no weapons, camera, communications equipment, maps or compasses on them.
Last weekend, they received eight-year prison sentences for their mistake. They received their first Western visitors Wednesday and appeared weary but in good health.
