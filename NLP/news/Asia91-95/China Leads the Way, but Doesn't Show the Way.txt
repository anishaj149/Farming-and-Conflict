By many measures, the world's most populous nation is also the world's biggest success story in family planning. But few will follow its example.
Since 1979, China has had a national policy limiting most couples to one child. Although the government maintains this is accomplished through education and persuasion, persistent reports over the years make clear that many women have been pressured or forced into abortions and sterilizations.
China's total fertility rate - the number of children born to the average woman - plunged from 6 in 1965 to 1.7 last year, the Chinese government says.
The fact that it remains well above 1 shows that the one-child policy is unevenly enforced. But it continues to draw sharp criticism from around the world, including from U.N. headquarters in New York.
"We have been very strong in our discussions with the Chinese government in trying to change this one-child policy," said Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. Population Fund.
"They must concentrate on quality programs and good information. The response from the public has been very positive in China, so they really don't need to resort to this kind of approach."
Despite the fall in fertility, China's population will continue to grow for a while, from the current 1.2 billion to a projected 1.3 billion in the year 2000, because so many pre-1979 babies are entering their child-bearing years.
