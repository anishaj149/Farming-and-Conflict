Here are the main points from the briefing by Vitaly Ignatenko, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's spokesman, concerning Iraq's response to the Soviet peace plan. Ignatenko spoke through a translator:
---
1) "Iraq states … its full and unconditional withdrawal of its forces from Kuwait."
2) "The withdrawal of forces begins on the second day after the cessation of hostilities."
3) "The withdrawal of forces will take place in a fixed time frame."
4) "After the withdrawal of two-thirds of all the forces, the Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the economic sanctions … will cease to apply to Iraq."
5) "After the end of the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait … the causes for the corresponding resolutions of the Security Council (will cease to exist), so thus those resolutions would cease to be in effect."
6) "...After the cease-fire all the POWs will be immediately released."
7) "The withdrawal of forces would be monitored by the countries not directly involved in the conflict, being so entrusted by the Security Council of the United Nations."
8) "The work on determining the details and specifications continues. The final outcome of this work will be made public today on the 22nd of February (before) the Security Council of the United Nations."
