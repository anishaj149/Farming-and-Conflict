When the Gulf War broke out, this nation's newspapers knew they had on their hands one of the biggest stories of these times.
In one way or another - or many - newspapers responded to what their editors generally say was an enormous, almost an insatiable, appetite for news of the war.
Editors across America report that:
-In the first days of the war, they sold about as many copies of their papers as they printed.
-Although some papers devoted as much as 70 percent of their news space to war news, they could not satisfy the public's appetite for even more. "They want to know everything they can, and we want to give them as much as we can," said Ken Amundsen, managing editor of the Loveland (Colo.) Reporter-Herald.
-Intense and immediate coverage of the war by television only seemed to increase readers' interest in printed accounts, and in maps and other graphics illustrating what was going on.
"The most dominating story I've seen since I've become a working journalist," is how Dave Greenfield, executive editor of the Daily Mail of Charleston, W.Va., characterized the story. "I don't think readers can get enough of it."
-People particularly responded to news about local men and women in the war zone and local units sent to Saudi Arabia.
-Readers wanted their views to be noticed. "We've experienced a spurt of letters to the editor, from both sides," said Bob Gallagher, editor of the Globe-Times of Bethlehem, Pa. "On a couple of days we've had to drop one of our regular columnists to fit in the volume of reader mail."
What characterizes the American press is its localness. Every day, across the continent, about 1,600 daily newspapers are manufactured in their own communities, each with a different mix, each made distinct by its choice of what to print.
So when war started in the Persian Gulf, 1,600 editors found a local way to tell the story to their communities.
A handful decided to print the American flag.
The Fargo (N.D.) Forum was one of them, and its full-page flag now can be seen on front doors all over Fargo and its sister city, Moorhead, Minn., said the managing editor of The Forum, Terry DeVine.
The Coeur d'Alene (Idaho) Press and The Dominion Post of Morgantown, W.Va., also ran full-page flags. The Dominion Post's Old Glory was printed on heavy paper as a one-page insert; 2,000 extra papers were sold. "We're still getting calls for it," said city editor John Pastor.
The flag that ran in the Washington (Pa.) Observer-Reporter covered two pages and bore the names and addresses of 167 local men and women serving in the Persian Gulf. Since then the list has grown.
The Visalia Times-Delta in California prints a running daily account of how three Visalia families are coping, mostly in quotations, intended to show the war's effects at home on a family with a son or daughter in the battle area. One day's installment told how the mother of a soldier in the gulf spent her day taking a bike ride and attending a support group meeting.
For some editors, the war had them doing what they'd only heard about, or seen in old newspaper movies. They put out an extra.
"I've been here 37 years and I don't ever remember us running a bona fide extra," said Tony Vella, managing editor of the Utica (N.Y.) Observer-Dispatch. The extra ran on Jan. 16, the day the war started, and sold 9,000 copies, a virtual sellout. The paper's normal circulation is 57,000.
The Orange County Register in California published four extra editions in the early hours of the war. On the first night 70,000 were sold, and on the second night 130,000, said Pat Elster, vice president of circulation. Street sales are still running 15 percent above normal.
The Omaha (Neb.) World-Herald published a 40,000-copy extra the morning after war broke out.
The Santa Barbara (Calif.) News-Press reduced the ratio of advertising to news to create more space for news.
It was a good decision journalistically, but not economically, said David McCumber, executive editor; revenue from increased sales of the paper didn't cover the extra cost of printing more pages of news. "That has not been an easy decision to make, economic times being what they are," McCumber said.
A complaint about the war, of sorts, came from Kurt Wanfried, managing editor of the Carlisle (Pa.) Sentinel. He said his paper would like to print color war photographs, "but so many of the photos from the desert are all tan, tan, tan."
The Kansas City Star has been devoting about three-fourths of page one to the war. "Just as the war was seeming to settle into something of a cruising speed and we considered pulling back a little, there were developments and events overtook us," said Monroe Dodd, managing editor.
The Durango (Colo.) Herald has devoted 70 percent of its news space to the war. "We have a (National Guard) medical company from this area deployed to the Persian Gulf, so interest is very high," said Dan Partridge, managing editor.
The Elko (Nev.) Daily Free Press ran an earthy banner headline when the war started: "We Kicked Ass."
Explained managing editor Chris Smith: "We looked around that morning and all the headlines said, 'War.' We thought, 'Let's give them an update on how we did."'
Twelve subscribers, offended, canceled. Others telephoned their unhappiness.
The war story had to compete with big local stories at some papers. In Porterville, Calif., the other story was the citrus freeze, which cost 3,000 jobs in a city of 29,500. To handle both stories, "we cut down the size of stories," said managing editor Rick Elkins of the Porterville Recorder.
In Florida, some papers had to balance war coverage against the Super Bowl. "It turned into a pretty good patriotic event rather than a football game," said William Dunn, managing editor of The Orlando Sentinel. "America really needed that."
And the war competed against the Super Bowl fortunes of the Buffalo Bills on the pages of the Democrat & Chronicle of Rochester, N.Y., not far from Buffalo.
"It was awkward trying to merge the Bills and the war," commented James Memmott, managing editor. "I was awfully glad to get the Super Bowl done with."
Editors say the public's fixation on the war news whetted, rather than reduced, their interest in printed accounts that could help them make sense of what they'd seen on television.
"People were looking to us to help distill it, and in some way sort out the somewhat-fractured CNN coverage," said Frank Barrows, deputy managing editor of The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer.
"What we're finding out is this is one of the times a newspaper is really needed," said Margo Ryan, editor of the Williston (N.D.) Herald. One Herald reporter, with two brothers in Saudi Arabia, has been assigned to write exclusively about local aspects of the war.
"Our experience has been that there is a thirst for war news," said William B. Brown, executive editor of the Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser and its sister paper, the Alabama Journal. "When the television networks began cutting back on their round-the-clock coverage, we got calls to our news desks asking for the latest information."
"Every time I go out, it's the primary topic at the table," added Doug Waggoner, executive editor of the News-Tribune in Jefferson City, Mo.
"I would have sensed any lack of interest, and normally I'm the person saying we can't get too heavy," said Bruce Giles, managing editor of The Ledger in Lakeland, Fla.
"Some readers want us to run full-page flag in the newspaper so they can cut it out and put it in their windows, while others want us to print a yellow ribbon every day on page one over the newspaper's name," said Sherman R. Frederick, editor of the Las Vegas (Nev.) Review-Journal. "But most people just want more information, especially graphics on geography, military tactics and warfare."
As for devoting space to the war, "It's just a given that the gulf gets whatever it takes" at the Idaho State Journal in Pocatello, said Lyle Olson, managing editor.
Kevin Giles, managing editor of the Bismarck (N.D.) Tribune, worries about overdoing it. "Overkill is a dangerous thing," he said. The Tribune has started running more non-war stories on page one.
So has the Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal, where Doug Oplinger, an assistant managing editor, said last Thursday, "For about a week now, we've been gradually moving other things on the first page."
Still, when war broke out, the Citrus County Chronicle of Crystal River, Fla., printed a non-local story on its front page for the first time in its history, said Tim Hess, managing editor for operations.
From Jan. 17 to Jan. 27, every story on the front page of the Sun Journal in New Bern, N.C. concerned the war. Managing editor Pat Holmes estimates his staff has devoted 80 to 90 percent of its time to local war-related stories.
The TimesDaily in Florence, Ala., a morning paper, published an afternoon edition called "War Update" for the first few days of the war.
The paper polled readers to see if it was overdoing coverage of the war. Not at all, they responded. "The people that read the TimesDaily still want comprehensive coverage," said Winford Turner, managing editor. "January has been the best month for circulation in the paper's history."
Jim Naughton, managing editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, said he did not think readers have become saturated.
"There's a risk of information overload, but not of knowledge overload," Naughton said. "A lot of what's been written and reported about the war doesn't answer fundamental questions like what have we done to Iraq or Baghdad."
The Inquirer has been devoting its Sunday Review and Opinion section exclusively to the gulf story.
The Bulletin in Bend, Ore. has set aside two full pages for war-related stories. "We've never given that much to any one thing for that long a period of time," said editor Robert W. Chandler.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution started out devoting six or more ad-free pages to war news, reported national editor Pilot Brice, and now lets developments dictate how much space the war gets. In the Newark Star-Ledger, the largest newspaper in New Jersey, war news consistently covers at least four pages, said editor Mort Pye.
New York Newsday runs eight to 12 extra pages.
Jumps in circulation, at papers big and small, confirm editors' instincts of profound reader interest.
The Record of Hackensack, N.J. sold 10 percent more copies the day after war started than the previous Thursday. In San Francisco, the Examiner is selling between 25,000 and 100,000 additional copies a day; its normal circulation is 145,000. The Pittsburgh (Pa.) Post-Gazette increased its press run by 25,000 copies. The Boston Globe published 90,000 extra copies on Jan. 17 and 18, after the war started.
The Oregonian of Portland saw an increase in circulation of 8,000 to 9,000 copies a day. The New York Post printed over one million papers the day after the war started and "had very few returns," said Gary Lewis, a spokesman for the paper.
But The New York Times printed 50,000 extra copies on Jan. 17 and 82,000 extra the next day. "We didn't have as dramatic an increase in production or sales because most of our readers are already interested in international affairs and ordinarily receive the paper," said Nancy Nielsen, director of corporate communications.
Another New York paper, the News, is profoundly affected by a bitter strike and so has no way to know how much sales have been affected by interest in the war, said John Campi, director of promotion.
Circulation initially jumped 30 to 40 percent at the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News and has leveled off to 10 percent above normal. Circulation rose by 10,000 copies at the Mobile (Ala.) Press Register, said Tom Taylor, executive editor. "It was all we could handle," he said.
The Huntsville (Ala.) News sold twice its usual 4,500 copies from newspaper vending machines, known as "racks."
The initial increase was 15 percent at the Cumberland (Md.) Times News, where, said managing editor Jan Alderton, "a lot of our local news on page one is being bumped and replaced with war news."
Jim Osteen, executive editor of the Gwinnett Daily News in Duluth, Ga., reported "all-time records" in rack sales.
The Record Searchlight of Redding, Calif., an afternoon paper, started printing earlier to get the paper on the news stands earlier. Saudi Arabia is 11 hours ahead of the West Coast, so much of the war news comes in when readers are asleep, giving afternoon papers a head start.
The Chronicle-Telegram of Elyria, Ohio, also moved up its deadline, said publisher Art Hudnutt, "to catch people wanting to read about what happened, at lunchtime."
Big city papers with the resources to cover the war with their own staffs have gone after the story vigorously. The Washington Post has rotated five reporters, all but one of them Arabic speakers. A Post reporter, Caryle Murphy, was in Kuwait for 26 days after its takeover by Iraq and wrote dramatic accounts of what she witnessed.
Across town, The Washington Times, normally published Monday through Friday, printed extras on Friday, Saturday and Sunday after the war started. Managing editor Wesley Pruden said he wants to make sure the war does not overwhelm other important news like the anti-reform backlash in the Soviet Union.
Bob Mong, managing editor of the Dallas Morning News, shares that view. Although the News ran as many as 14 extra pages a day of war news during the first week, said Mong, "You have to keep an eye on the Baltics, you have to keep an eye on Moscow. We've got a transition in state government that you've got to watch."
And, war or no war, "we try to get something light on the front page," said Dan Baker, managing editor of the Milledgeville (Ga.) Union-Recorder.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch had two reporters in the gulf region but last week sent columnist Bill McClellan to cover the human angle. "He's the closest thing we have to an Ernie Pyle," said executive city editor Laszlo Domjan.
Many papers are finding ways to localize the war story. The Coeur d'Alene (Idaho) Press plans to run a section with almost 260 brief stories, profiles and photos and mailing addresses of local people serving in the gulf. "I've never seen such a public response to coverage of something in my 20 years in the business," said Barry Casebolt, executive editor.
The Eagle-Tribune of Lawrence, Mass., has run about 250 pictures of local people serving in the Gulf.
A pilot who bombed Baghdad on the second day of the war called his parents in York, Neb., to describe the experience. The York News-Times had the story on page one that day, said managing editor Kurt Johnson. "The more direct to the front-line troops, the better people like it," he said.

Some other aspects of how the nation's papers have been dealing with this overwhelming story:
-Anti-war protest has been a touchy subject for some papers. Robert Ryan, managing editor of the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News, said there have been complaints from protesters who think the story is being underplayed "and we're getting a lot of calls from people that any coverage is too much."
-Sometimes coverage can be too rough. After the Bradford (Pa.) Era ran a story about a firm that manufactures body bags, said managing editor Paul Reichart, a few readers canceled their subscriptions.
-The Charleston (W.Va) Gazette drew a reader's complaint when it ran an anti-war editorial cartoon showing Uncle Sam holding a dead soldier. "I thought it was in bad taste myself," said editor Don Marsh.
-And the juxtaposition of two stories - one about men missing in action, the other about how to get conscientious objector status - drew a protest from readers of the Great Falls (Mont.) Tribune, said Gary Moseman, managing editor.
-Spokesman Richard Gulla of the Boston Globe said the Globe has lost some advertising because of the war, "particularly in the travel area, airlines and some locations outside the country."
-Letters to the editor picked up at the Times-Standard of Eureka, Calif., after the city council in nearby Arcata declared the city a sanctuary for war resisters. Under public pressure, the council reversed itself.
-From Al Clark, managing editor, The Daily Reflector of Greenville, N.C.: "So far, I don't see a boredom backlash." Said Ted Brockish, editor of the Scottsbluff (Neb.) Star-Herald: "Face it, the war is on people's minds. My sense is that generally they want to know as much about it as they can, and they use a newspaper to try to tie the whole thing together."
-Added Beth Bohn, city editor of another Nebraska paper, the Hastings Tribune: "You get calls every day from parents, when they last heard from their child, and what's going on."
-The News-Herald of Panama City, Fla., has given saturation coverage to the war, with other stories rarely making page one. "Readers should not permit themselves to lose interest in the war," said editor Steve Bornhoft. "They should not be complacent about the war."
-"We've been operating under the theory that you can't get too much information on the war," said Mark Smidt, managing editor of the Miles City Star in Montana, which devoted as much as 20 percent of its space to the war. "People have appreciated that and even told us about it."
-Tim Atseff, managing editor of the Syracuse (N.Y.) Herald-Journal, made the point this way: "Our feeling is that TV has saturated the public in the first two weeks and the worm is now turning. There's a revulsion among viewers. They're now turning to the print medium, where they can pick and choose the stories they want to read. … With TV, there's no place to run."
-Circulation is breaking records at The (Santa Fe) New Mexican, said David N. Mitchell, managing editor, but that may be more due to a mass slaying in the village of Chimayo than the war. "That has been more powerful than the gulf," he said. And Scott Stinnett, managing editor of the Portales (N.M.) News-Tribune said a circulation jump at his paper may be due to coverage of a sex abuse trial "with a lot of explicit stuff."
-The Nashville (Tenn.) Banner added 18 to 25 columns of space to accommodate war news. Last Wednesday, said managing editor Tony Kessler, war news was even on the front of the food section - "a story about the high-tech food the military is using."
-"My gut was telling me I ought to back off a little bit, but now I don't know," Bill Thomas, executive editor of the Oakland Press of Pontiac, Mich., said last Wednesday, the day of the first big land clash of the war. "I still think people look to the newspaper to put some background and stability on the coverage."
-In Virginia, the Lynchburg News & Daily Advance is devoting virtually all its space for national and international news to the war, said Joe Stinnett, managing editor. "We're running briefs columns for everything else," he said.
-But some papers have cut down on war coverage. "We devoted a lot of space to war coverage originally, but now we're pretty much back to normal," said Chris Miller, managing editor of the Daily Spectrum of St. George, Utah. At another Utah paper, the Ogden Standard-Examiner, managing editor Brian Mertz said coverage has tapered off from an eight-page section the first day to about six to nine columns a day.
-The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal has tapered off the space devoted to war news, said Dan Henderson, an assistant managing editor, "but we've got the full flexibility to go back up as soon as that's warranted."
-The Morning Sun of Mount Pleasant, Mich., is getting back to local news. "Life does go on and there are other things in our community that we need to cover," said editor Fred Strohl.
-Executive editor Bob Haring of the Tulsa (Okla.) World said he was concerned about balancing war and other news. "By the third or fourth day, we deliberately tried to get one or two non-war stories on page one every day," he said. Editor Jenk Jones Jr. of the Tulsa Tribune said he's aware of the need for balance, but on this war "it's always better to have too much coverage than not enough."
-After the Denver Post ran stories about Colorado firms that make high-tech weapons, the paper got some angry calls, said Todd Engdahl, executive city editor. The callers complained, "You're just telling the saboteurs where to go," he said.
-Circulation jumped at the Dothan (Ala.) Eagle, but after the first week, "returned to pre-war figures," said Terry Connor, managing editor. Same story at the Batavia (N.Y.) Daily News and at the Olean (N.Y.) Times-Herald, which saw an increase of nearly 10 percent during the war's first week.
-Reader requests caused the Huntsville (Ala.) Times to reprint a special two-page section with a color map and geographic, demographic and historical summaries on the Persian Gulf, first printed in August.
-The war was a local story, indeed, to many readers of the Northwest Florida Daily News of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., near Eglin Air Force Base, where many "smart" weapons have been tested. Managing editor Tom Conner said five reporters have been assigned to full-time war news coverage since the bombs started falling.
-"We're probably averaging three local stories a day," said Evan Miller, managing editor of the Jackson (Tenn.) Sun. The special edition it published when the war broke out is a local collector's item, he said.
-Interest in the war is high in Elizabethton, Tenn., a town of 12,000, because a local National Guard unit has been sent to Saudi Arabia. "It's pretty well touched the whole community so we're devoting quite a bit of coverage to it," said Rozella Hardin, editor of the Elizabethton Star.
-Bob Ebener, managing editor of The Press of Atlantic City, N.J., commented: "We must be serving a valid purpose or circulation wouldn't be where it is. People obviously aren't getting it all from CNN." His paper sells about 3,000 extra copies a day. Adds Ward Bushee, executive editor of the Reno (Nev.) Gazette-Journal: "I think people are maxed out on TV and are going back to papers to find out what's going on."
-Six northwestern Mississippi newspapers are putting together a combined 20-page edition to bring "a little touch of home to our folks overseas," said Joe Lee III, owner and publisher of Grenada Newspapers, which owns three of the papers. Participating are The Daily Sentinel-Star in Grenada; Tate County Democrat in Senatobia; The Panolian in Batesville; the Tunica Times-Democrat in Tunica; The Monitor Herald in Bruce; and the DeSoto Times in Hernando.
-The Daily Times-News of Burlington, N.C., offered a free 30-day subscription to readers' relatives in the Persian Gulf area. The paper expected 10 or 15 takers, but got over 100, said Tim Timmons, managing editor.
-Papers know that nothing competes with local coverage. "When some local people were in Jerusalem during the Scud missile bombardment," said Cliff Schectman, managing editor of the Wilkes-Barre (Pa.) Times-Leader, "we called them to see what they had to say about Saddam (Hussein's) terror.
-The Centre Daily Times of State College, Pa., runs a Monday column called "Over There," with information about local people at the war front and another, "Still There" with updates on their status. As for finding room for war news, comments managing editor Karen Lobeck: "You add some space and you steal some space."
-"We try to bring the news home as much as possible," said Steve Piatt, news editor of the Sayre (Pa.) Evening Times. "Even though this is a small community, we've got a ton of kids over there."
-The Albany (Ore.) Democrat-Herald runs a daily list of servicemen and women sent to the gulf.
-Said editor Paul Neely, who runs three pages of war news in the Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times: "We have not had the equivalent of people complaining that TV has canceled their soap operas."
-Joe Goodman, managing editor, the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, on what readers want: "They want graphics. They want maps that help them locate their loved ones over there, any shred of information that gives them a clue as to what their loved ones are doing."
-The Nevada Appeal of Carson City printed a "wraparound extra" - a page wrapped around its regular edition - the day after the war broke out, and some advertisers asked not to have their ads included. "They didn't want to show a connection with the war," said editor Don Ham.
-The Bloomsburg (Pa.) Press-Enterprise is looking ahead. "We're a six-days-a-week paper, but we have put a plan into the works to publish on Sunday if something happens of tremendous importance overnight Friday or on a Saturday - something like the end of the war, the death of (Saddam) Hussein or the start of the ground war," said Mike Stewart, managing editor. "Any of these would make us pull the trigger. We've also talked about special editions at the end of the war, if people aren't sick of it by then."
-In a mutual arrangement, the Lincoln Star and the Lincoln Journal of Nebraska printed a page of maps and gulf-related facts last week and sold 4,000 copies to area schools.
"I think our readers are satisfied with our coverage," said Ted Como, managing editor of the Kingsport (Tenn.) Times-News, "because I'm sure if they weren't, they would let us know."
-A comment from Mike McNeill, managing editor of the Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth: "Greenwood is a small town and especially with the 173rd (Quartermaster Company) activation, virtually everyone knows somebody in the Middle Eastern theater. … We're getting lots of calls from readers with good story ideas and we pursue all except the redundant. How many photos do we need of yellow ribbons being tied to trees?"
-Several times a week, the Finger Lakes Times in Geneva, N.Y., has run a section called "Letters from Home" listing the names, ranks and addresses of local residents serving in the gulf. Local grade school classes have written to the service members and the troops have written to thank the paper, said Donald C. Hadley, managing editor.
-The increase in letters to the editor was threefold, from 20 a day to 60 a day, at the Bakersfield Californian, executive editor Robert Bentley reported.
-The Daily Oklahoman, of Oklahoma City, Okla., has printed lots of maps. "I think a lot of people didn't bother to see where the Middle East was before the war," said Mike Shannon, senior assistant managing editor.
-The Gloucester County Times in Woodbury, N.J., is making no effort to offset grim war news, said Bill Long, editor. "We don't deliberately look for warm, fuzzy news as a counterbalance," he said.
-"Everybody is talking about it; I don't think people are burned out on reading about the war," said Rick Fitzgerald, metro editor of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) News, which has run four open pages a day on the war.
-Readers turned off? "We're worried about it," said Rick Foote, editor of the Montana Standard of Butte, Mont. "It's still a front-page war."
-"We're trying to gear the local coverage to the readers who may get tired of seeing the same kinds of reports over and over again," said Frank Craig, city editor of the Crescent-News of Defiance, Ohio. "We feel these readers will still relate to stories about people that they know from the community whose kids are in Saudi Arabia."
-Said Mike Tonos, managing editor of the Sun Herald of Biloxi-Gulfport, Miss.: "To give our readers a break, we have been pushing more non-war stories back out to A-1 - weather, census, etc."
-Editor Gerald Crawford said the Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, after devoting four pages a day to war coverage, planned to cut that amount by half this week. Of course, if the ground war starts, the paper will return to saturation coverage, he said.
-Another New Mexico paper, the Las Cruces Sun-News, will bump its stories inside the paper if the conflict becomes a prolonged one. "If we did any more we would have overkill," said managing editor Warren Weber.
-The Columbus (Neb.) Telegram gave away a special limited edition the day war broke out, said editor Steve Chatelain.
-From Mel Toadvine, editor of The Daily Times of Salisbury, Md.: "People still read, but they're watching the war on TV as if it were a mini-series."
-Tracy Cartier, editor-in-chief, said the Gardner (Mass.) News has not added extra pages. "The economy dictates that," she said.
-If the war continues to be fought mostly in the air, the amount of space devoted to it at the Daily Banner in Cleveland, Tenn., will decrease, said Corky Hoover, executive editor. But if it becomes a ground war, the opposite is true.
