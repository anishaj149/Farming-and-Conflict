Discovery's seven astronauts face a packed schedule on their eight-day trip into space as they conduct a series of experiments devoted to "Star Wars" research.
The all-male crew will work in split shifts around-the-clock on a series of tests designed to study the atmosphere and the shuttle's exhaust plumes and chemical and gas releases. The military will use the information to develop sensors for tracking enemy missiles.
A satellite will be deployed to track a variety of shuttle maneuvers before it is then retrieved by the astronauts. Another payload will remain in the shuttle's cargo bay.
It is the first unclassified shuttle flight for the Pentagon, and NASA officials consider it one of the most complex missions ever because of all the intricate maneuvering required.
The astronauts said the information they hope to gather could be used to develop systems similar to the Patriot missiles used to thwart Iraqi Scud missile attacks in the Persian Gulf War.
"A lot of people think (Star Wars is) a waste of money," said Discovery mission specialist Guion S. Bluford Jr. But "in a world where there are more and more countries developing Scud-type missiles and nuclear capabilities, we need to develop the technology to defend against that."
Bluford and Discovery commander Michael L. Coats are space veterans, while the other five crew members are shuttle rookies.

Coats, a Navy captain and former test pilot, is a two-time space traveler who has made all his shuttle trips on Discovery.
The 45-year-old astronaut last flew into space as commander of a 1989 flight in which the crew deployed a communications satellite.
Coats first flew into space as a pilot on Discovery's maiden flight in 1984. Three satellites were deployed and the astronauts, nicknamed the "icebusters," used the shuttle's robot arm to scrape hazardous ice off the shuttle.
During this flight, the astronauts will collect data for the Defense Department.
"When they came up with SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative), we were worried about the Russians. Well, people don't tend to worry about the Russians anymore, but I think one thing we've learned from Iraq is that there's other people out there who can hurt us," Coats said in an interview earlier this year.
Coats was born in Sacramento, Calif., and grew up in Riverside, Calif., where he graduated from Ramona High School.
An Annapolis graduate, he also earned two master's degrees - one in administration, science and technology from George Washington University and the other in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.
Coats flew 315 combat missions in Southeast Asia in the early 1970s. He also was a naval flight instructor before attending the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Md.
Coats, selected as an astronaut in 1978, served as acting chief of the astronaut office from May 1989 to March 1990.
He is married and has two children.

Bluford, a mission specialist aboard Discovery, is a veteran of two previous shuttle flights.
During his third space trip, Bluford's main responsibility is to operate a $$160 million Air Force apparatus that will study such phenomena as the northern lights, cirrus clouds and the atmosphere.
"We're doing an awful lot on this flight," he said. "This flight requires much more training than any of the previous flights that I've flown on."
Selected as an astronaut in 1979, Bluford was the first black to fly in space on an August 1983 mission aboard Challenger. The flight also featured the first night launch and landing of a shuttle.
He next flew in October 1985 aboard the German spacelab mission.
Bluford, 48, was born in Philadelphia, where he graduated from Overbrook Senior High School.
He earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from Pennsylvania State University and a master's degree and doctorate in aerospace engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology. He also earned a master's degree in business administration four years ago from the University of Houston at Clear Lake.
As a pilot, Bluford flew 144 combat missions in North Vietnam. He has logged more than 4,800 hours jet flight time in seven different types of aircraft, including 1,300 hours as a T-38 instructor pilot. The astronauts train in T-38s.
He is married and has two children.

Air Force Maj. L. Blaine Hammond, a space rookie and pilot aboard Discovery, is responsible for assisting the commander as needed throughout the military mission.
Discovery's flight, with its many goals and ambitious schedule, is "sort of considered the grand slam of all missions," Hammond said.
While several of the other astronauts operate the satellite once it is deployed, Coats and Hammond will be busy putting the shuttle through a variety of maneuvers so the spacecraft can study the orbiter's exhaust plumes.
"There's a lot for me to do - help Mike (Coats) get everything set up and be his second set of eyeballs," Hammond said. "There's just so much to learn and so much to do."
Hammond, 39, was born in Savannah, Ga., and graduated from Kirkwood High School in Kirkwood, Mo.
He attended the U.S. Air Force Academy, earning a bachelor's degree in engineering science and mechanics. He also earned a master's degree in the same field from Georgia Institute of Technology.
He attended the Empire Test Pilot School in Britain and was a test pilot school instructor at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. He was selected as an astronaut in 1984.
He is married and has two children.
Astronaut Gregory J. Harbaugh, a mission specialist and one of five space rookies aboard Discovery, will be controlling the shuttle's robot arm when needed during his 12-hour space shift.
Harbaugh, 35, also is one of two astronauts who will operate the SDI spacecraft that will measure infrared and other kinds of radiation emitted from Discovery. Additionally, he is trained to perform an emergency spacewalk if necessary.
"The most challenging thing for us to pull off are these clean data takes," he said. "They are so finely orchestrated and so time-critical. We've demonstrated that we can do it in the (shuttle) simulator, but we've also demonstrated that if anything goes wrong, we're not going to get the data" on every opportunity.
Born in Cleveland, Harbaugh grew up in Willoughby, Ohio, and graduated from Willoughby South High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Purdue University and a master's degree in physical science from the University of Houston at Clear Lake.
Harbaugh has worked at the Johnson Space Center since graduating from Purdue in 1978. Before being selected as an astronaut, he held several engineering and technical management positions involved in shuttle flight operations.
He is married and has two children.

Mission specialist Richard J. Hieb is another space rookie who has spent years working on shuttle missions from the ground.
During his first trip into space, Hieb will operate the SDI spacecraft.
Despite the mission's many goals, Hieb believes the crew is well prepared for the hectic pace.
"I'm very comfortable with the mission outline although it's very aggressive," he said. "We understand our job."
Hieb was born in Jamestown, N.D., and graduated from Jamestown High School. A National Merit Scholar, he earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from Northwest Nazarene College and a master's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado.
After graduating from the University of Colorado in 1979, Hieb went to work at the Johnson Space Center helping develop crew procedures and activities. He also worked in Mission Control as part of the ascent team for the first shuttle flight, and during rendezvous phases on several other shuttle flights.
Hieb was selected as an astronaut in 1985.
"I always wanted to be an astronaut," he said. "I didn't seriously think I ever would be. I came to work for NASA because I wanted to work in the space program. So when I got the opportunity to apply, I was thrilled to apply and even more thrilled to get it."
The 35-year-old astronaut is married and has two children.

Air Force Lt. Col. Donald R. McMonagle, a mission specialist and flight engineer aboard Discovery, is one of two crew members trained to do an emergency spacewalk if necessary.
McMonagle also has been trained as a backup pilot for the mission and will monitor the shuttle's systems during the busy flight.
"I think all of us realistically expect that there will be hiccups in the time line," McMonagle said. "I think that's the nature of the business. We are a very success-oriented mission."
"We're fairly sure we'll get those high-priority objectives," he said.
The 38-year-old astronaut was born in Flint, Mich., where he graduated from Hamady High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in astronautical engineering from the Air Force Academy and a master's degree in mechanical engineering from California State University in Fresno.
As an Air Force pilot, he completed a one-year tour of duty in South Korea and then returned to Holloman Air Force Base, N.M. He later attended the Air Force test pilot school at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., where he was the outstanding graduate in his class.
He was the operations officer of the 6513th Test Squadron at Edwards when he was selected as an astronaut in 1987.
He is married and has one child.

Mission specialist Charles Lacy Veach is one of two astronauts whose primary responsibility is to operate an Air Force payload that will study infrared and ultraviolet rays in the Earth's atmosphere.
Veach, 46, a longtime NASA employee, is making his first trip into space.
The mission has "come together very well, and I think we're confident this is going to work," Veach said. "It's an opportunity for the shuttle and the whole shuttle team to strut their stuff."
Veach was born in Chicago and grew up in Honolulu, where he graduated from Punahou School. He earned a bachelor's degree in engineering management from the Air Force Academy.
He joined the Air Force after graduating from high school and later attended fighter gunnery school at Luke Air Force Base, Calif.
For 14 years, he was an Air Force fighter pilot. His assignments included a 275-mission combat tour in Vietnam.
Veach also was a member of the Thunderbirds, the Air Force air demonstration squadron, for two years. Although he left active duty in 1981, he continues to fly as an F-4 pilot with the Texas Air National Guard.
He began working at the Johnson Space Center in 1982 as an engineer and research pilot. He was selected as an astronaut in 1984.
He is married and has two children.
