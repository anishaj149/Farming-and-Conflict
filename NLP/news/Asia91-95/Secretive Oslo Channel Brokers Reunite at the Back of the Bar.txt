At a back table in the Palm Garden bar, the old friends of "The Oslo Channel" swapped tales about their secret talks on Middle East peace.
The Norwegian, Palestinian and Israeli merchants of peace were back for a well-deserved reward: watching Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat receive the Nobel Peace Prize today.
Without the efforts of the tight-knit team gathered at the bar in Oslo's Grand Hotel, there might never have been a peace accord to honor.
Those at the reunion included Terje Roed Larsen and his wife Mona Juul, two Norwegians who spotted the chance to open a back-door channel between bitter enemies - Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization - while on a trip to the Gaza Strip.
With them, smiling, relaxed and joking, was Yossi Beilin, the Israeli deputy foreign minister who helped open the channel.
There was Israeli negotiator Uri Savir and the PLO's Ahmed Qureia, usually called Abu Ala. Both went to Norway more than a dozen times for secret meetings that led to the agreement on Palestinian self-rule, signed in September 1993 at the White House.
"We didn't believe a year ago that it would be possible to implement the agreement in the way it was implemented," Beilin said. "We envisioned the problems, the violence, but we couldn't believe that such a day could come so soon that the whole world would acknowledge the importance."
