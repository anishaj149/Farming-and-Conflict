A look at the four men believed responsible for the July 7 London bombings and others involved in the investigation:
---
Shahzad Tanweer, 22, died in a suicide bomb attack on a subway train near Aldgate station, police say. Tanweer attended Leeds Metropolitan University, where he studied sports science and developed a special interest in cricket. He had a younger brother and two sisters and always lived in the Beeston area of the city of Leeds in northern England. His father was born in Pakistan and owns a fish-and-chips shop. Tanweer went to Lahore, Pakistan, for two months this year to study Islam, said his uncle, Bashir Ahmed. Media reports said he was arrested once for shoplifting.

Hasib Hussain, 18, killed himself when he blew up a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square, police say. Hussain lived with his family in the Leeds suburb of Holbeck his entire life, according to neighbors. From September 1998 until July 2003, he attended Matthew Murray High School, completing vocational business studies. He reportedly became a more devout Muslim two years ago, according to police, who questioned neighbors. Media reports said police once questioned Hussain for disorderly behavior. On Thursday, police released an image of Hussain wearing a backpack, taken by a CCTV camera as he passed through Luton train station north of London headed to the capital.

Mohammed Sidique Khan, 30, was born in Britain of Pakistani parents, according to The Times of London. Married and the father of an 8-month-old girl, he has been identified as a suspect by British media. Police have not publicly named him as a suspect. Khan originally lived in the same area of Leeds as Tanweer, but moved five months ago to Dewsbury in West Yorkshire. He worked with disabled children and his wife, Hasina, was involved in education, neighbors said. He was also a Muslim, although one neighbor, Imran Zaman, said he had never seen Khan at the local mosque. Documents belonging to Khan were found in the debris of the Edgware Road subway blast, media reports said. Police have said that property in the name of a third man who traveled to London from West Yorkshire - reportedly Khan - was found at both the Aldgate and Edgware Road sites, but there was no evidence proving he died at either blast.

Lindsey Germaine, a Jamaican-born Briton, has been identified by BBC TV and Sky News as the fourth bomber. Police haven't named the fourth suspect, but said the attacker likely died in the explosion between King's Cross and Russell Square stations.

Magdy Asi el-Nashar, 33, an Egyptian-born academic who recently did biochemical research at Leeds University, is being sought by police, The Times has reported, adding that he is believed to have rented one of the homes searched by police in Leeds. Neighbors said el-Nashar recently left Britain, claiming he had a problem with his visa. Leeds University said el-Nashar moved to Leeds in October 2000 to do biochemical research sponsored by the National Research Center in Cairo. He earned a doctorate May 6 but hasn't been seen on campus since early July. El-Nashar studied chemical engineering at North Carolina State University for a semester beginning in January 2000, NCSU spokesman Keith Nichols said.

A man was shown with the four bombers in CCTV tape taken at King's Cross station, according to the Evening Standard newspaper. The Daily Telegraph said police were trying to identify a man seen standing near the four suspects on the platform at Luton railway station, where they apparently boarded a train for London on the morning of the bombings. The BBC also said police were seeking a fifth suspect. Police refused to comment on the reported search.

A 29-year-old man was arrested by police Tuesday after they raided six homes in Leeds, including those of three of the suspected bombers. A judge approved his detention through Saturday. The Press Association identified the detainee as a relative of one of the suspected attackers.
