The main duties and powers of the Iranian president:
ON PAPER: The president is the highest elected politician and officially holds the No. 2-ranking post behind the supreme leader, who heads the non-elected ruling clerics. The president directs many key policies, including foreign relations and the economy, through the Cabinet.
The president also heads the Supreme National Security Council, which oversees defense and security issues. The council is the lead agency in crucial talks with the West on Iran's nuclear program.
IN REALITY: The theocracy can effectively neutralize the president. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his hand-picked inner circle have blanket authority to overrule any decision or initiative. The ruling clerics also control powerful groups such as the judiciary and the Revolutionary Guards, which are separate from the regular armed forces under the leadership of the defense minister.
