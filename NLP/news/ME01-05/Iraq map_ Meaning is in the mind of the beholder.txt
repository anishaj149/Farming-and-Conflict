A map can have different meanings depending on who's looking at it.
Called to Capitol Hill amid mounting concern over the cost and length of U.S. involvement in Iraq, the war's commander, Gen. Tommy Franks, went before the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday with a map highlighting the problem areas.
There, on a large, bright green Iraq, was a small, brown-shaded triangle and several tiny yellow-shaded dots.
This is where U.S. troops have most often come under attack, Franks said. "It represents where we see more than 90 percent of the difficulties," he said.
The map indicated that only a small portion of Iraq - a country about the size of California - presented problems. The brown triangle included Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, and a region where Saddam drew support for his government. The yellow dots marked several of Iraq's major cities.
But wait, said Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif.
"What I find fascinating is the … triangle and these little spots that have all the problems represent 70 percent of the Iraqi population," she said.
Most of Iraq's 25 million people live along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, inside the triangle. Most of the country's vast western areas are desert.
