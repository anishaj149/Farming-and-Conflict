The "Green Zone" is an area on the west side of the Tigris River centered on Saddam Hussein's Republican Palace, a huge building topped with monumental busts of the ousted Iraqi leader that serves as headquarters of the Coalition Provisional Authority.
The zone, marked by more trees and greenery than the rest of dusty and arid Baghdad, includes dozens of smaller palatial buildings, houses and office buildings - even a hospital - where high-ranking members of the old Baath Party regime formerly resided.
The U.S.-led coalition has now ringed the enclave with miles of 13-foot-high concrete walls, razor wire, sandbag bunkers and guard posts manned by U.S. troops.
Within the Green Zone, U.S. and other coalition officials, including chief administrator L. Paul Bremer, can move about in relative safety, making key decisions about the rule of the country.
