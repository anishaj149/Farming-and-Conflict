Iraqi authorities imposed the first nighttime curfew in more than a year on Baghdad and surrounding areas Tuesday in the latest use of new emergency powers, the prime minister's office said.
The curfew was announced a day after guerrillas carried out a string of attacks, including bombings of two churches, that killed nine people and wounded 80 - just as U.S. and Iraqi forces were launching a major offensive against insurgents in the city of Fallujah, to the west.
Interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's office said the curfew was imposed under "the authority given to us by the emergency laws" announced over the weekend.
"We decided to impose a curfew on Baghdad and its outskirts from 10:30 p.m. at night to 4 a.m. starting Tuesday November 9, 2004 until further notice," the statement said
It marked the first time that the Iraqi capital has been under curfew since Oct. 26, 2003, when the U.S.-led coalition lifted restrictions imposed after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime.
Allawi flexed the emergency laws on Monday to impose a round-the-clock curfew on Fallujah and the nearby insurgent stronghold of Ramadi. He also closed Baghdad's international airport for 48 hours and sealed the borders with Syria and Jordan.
