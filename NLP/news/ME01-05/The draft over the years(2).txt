WASHINGTON (AP) - The draft over the years:
1775-1782 - In the Revolutionary War, Gen. George Washington asks the states to allow the central government to conscript soldiers, but they turn him down. As volunteering subsides, some states hold an occasional draft, producing more paid substitutes than actual draftees.
1789 - Newly adopted Constitution gives Congress the "power to raise and support armies" but doesn't mention conscription.
1812 - Some states draft men for the War of 1812, but President Madison fails to get Congress to enact a national draft. Daniel Webster denounces the idea as "Napoleonic despotism."
1862 - In the Civil War, the Confederacy adopts a law drafting men under age 50. Draft generates 21 percent of the Confederacy's 1 million soldiers. Resentment stirred by exemptions of overseers on large plantations.
1863 - The North initiates a draft of men 20-45. Attempts to enforce the draft touch of bloody rioting in New York City and elsewhere. The well-to-do can escape the draft by paying a $300 bounty or hiring a substitute. Of 2.1 million Union troops, the draft yields 46,000 conscripts and 118,000 substitutes.
1917 - With America entering World War I, President Wilson overcomes opposition from the South and West and ethnic and political opponents of the war to get a draft enacted without bounties or substitutes. Conscription raises 2.8 million men - more than 2 out of 3 troops.
1940 - First peacetime draft adopted. It runs through 1945, and extends to men as old as 45. Some get occupational exemptions. About 10 million are drafted.
1943 - Fathers lose their draft exemption.
1947 - Draft ends briefly, but is revived because of Cold War tensions.
1951 - A draft of doctors begins.
1965 - Draft card destruction made a crime.
1965-75 - The government indicts 22,500 for draft offenses, imprisons 4,500. In some years, more men get conscientious objection exemptions than are inducted.
1964-73 - During years of the Vietnam draft and mass protest, 27 million men reach draft age, 15 million get legal exemptions or deferments, 570,000 evade the draft illegally. Of those, 4,000 are imprisoned. Up to 50,000 flee into exile.
1968 - Candidate Richard Nixon says he wants to move toward an all-volunteer army after the Vietnam conflict ends.
1969 - In light of protests over the draft's inequities, President Nixon switches to a lottery system.
1970 - Nixon ends granting of new occupational or paternity deferments.
1973 - On the day a Vietnam ceasefire is announced, the government stops drafting. Congress raises military pay, initiates an all-volunteer military.
1975 - President Ford suspends registration.
1977 - President Carter issues blanket pardon of draft dodgers.
1980 - Carter, in reaction to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, resumes registration.
1980-1984 - An estimated 500,000 refuse to register; a handful are prosecuted.
