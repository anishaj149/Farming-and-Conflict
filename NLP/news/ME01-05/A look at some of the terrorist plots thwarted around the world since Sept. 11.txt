U.S. authorities and officials overseas say that since Sept. 11 they have prevented terrorist strikes against American targets or U.S. citizens in Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Malaysia, Indonesia, France, Bosnia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, India, Australia and Singapore. A look at some of the foiled attacks:
- Two days after Sept. 11, an Algerian, a Frenchman and a Dutchman are arrested in a European-wide sweep of groups suspected of links to al-Qaida, accused with several others of plotting to bomb the U.S. embassy in Paris.
Prosecutors say the group also targeted the Kleine-Brogel base in northeast Belgium, where around 100 U.S. Air Force personnel are stationed.
- On. Dec. 22, Richard Reid, a British citizen and convert to Islam was subdued by crew members and passengers aboard an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami after allegedly trying to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes.
- In a December sweep, Singapore authorities arrested 13 men suspected of plotting to blow up Western embassies, U.S. Navy ships and American companies in the city-state. Some of the men, all from the Jemaah Islamiyah militant group, had trained in Afghanistan.
- In October, the U.S. and British embassies in Bosnia were closed for several days after local police arrested six naturalized Bosnians, all of them Algerian natives, suspected of plotting attacks on U.S. interests in Bosnia and elsewhere.
