The sound of gunfire and small explosions were heard early Monday in Bethlehem outside of the Church of the Nativity, where Palestinian gunmen and clerics have been holed up for seven days, a priest said.
Black smoke also rose from one of the windows of the compound belonging to the church, built over the traditional birthplace of Jesus, but it was not immediately clear what was burning.
Father Ibrahim Faltas, the superior of the Franciscan community in the church, said he heard the shooting just outside of the building. He said that Israeli soldiers did not enter the church, and he didn't know what started the gunbattle.
Israeli soldiers have been using loudspeakers to demand that the gunmen surrender, but they have refused to come out. The troops have been reluctant to storm the church. Any damage to the sacred site would cause an international uproar.
Israeli forces moved into Bethlehem shortly after they began their 11-day offensive in the West Bank, an operation that is targeting militant networks blamed for a series of suicide bombings in Israel.
