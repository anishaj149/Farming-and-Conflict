The following are quotes from former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic's address to the U.N. war crimes tribunal:
-
 
"In the West, we see a complete media darkness where it comes to Yugoslavia, because world global networks have been assigned the task of being an instrument of war and of disinforming the public."
<-
"This is the first opportunity that I have been given after seven months here to address the public.
-
 
"Everybody who lent support - the government, the parliament, various political organizations, the media - they all stand accused here. The citizens stand accused, citizens who lent their massive support and elected their representatives at free party elections. We agree on one point, that my conduct was the expression of the will of the people. But the prosecution is accusing the population of supporting me, and let me say that my behavior here is an expression of the will of the people as well.
-
 
"The prosecution is uttering such horrendous lies, what we have heard here insults the intelligence of this planet."
-
 
"Your bosses broke up Yugoslavia. They pushed Bosnia into a civil war. The Serbs did not start the war. It is nonsensical to accuse the wrong side."
-
 
"I'm not trying to say that some individuals did not do this, but the police and army defended the country courageously and honorably."
-
 
"America crosses the globe to struggle against terrorism in Afghanistan, but to fight terrorism in the heart of your own country is considered to be a crime. Our defense was a heroic defense against the aggression of the NATO pact."
