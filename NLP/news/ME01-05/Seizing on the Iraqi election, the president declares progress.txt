President Bush said Sunday that pulling out of Iraq would signal to the world that America cannot be trusted to keep its word and that the elections in the Middle East nation mean the United States has "an ally of growing strength."
Leaving too soon "would hand Iraq over to enemies who have pledged to attack us," the president said in remarks prepared for delivery in an Oval Office address.
Bush's speech tops off an 18-day span in which the president made five speeches conceding setbacks in Iraq. At the same time, he is outlining a strategy he says will enable the Iraqi people to establish a stable political system and a strong defense capable of quelling a stubborn insurgency.
"This election will not mean the end of violence," the president said. "But it is the beginning of something new: constitutional democracy at the heart of the Middle East."
Bush's address follows a string of weekend attacks by insurgents in Iraq that pierced three days of relative calm. Nineteen people died, including two relatives of a senior Kurdish official.
"Some look at the challenges in Iraq, and conclude that the war is lost, and not worth another dime or another day," the president said. "I don't believe that. Our military commanders do not believe that."
The president said that withdrawing "before our work is done" would "abandon out Iraq friends - and signal to the world that America cannot be trusted to keep its word."
