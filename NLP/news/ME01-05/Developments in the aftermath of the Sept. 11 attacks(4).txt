Developments Friday in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks:
 
- The government opens offices for a new aid program that would give families of victims of the terrorist attacks an average of $1.65 million - a plan that some families say doesn't go far enough.
- As many as 500 firefighters who worked at the World Trade Center site are on leave for respiratory problems and other rescue-related injuries, and a union leader warns that the ailments could force many into retirement.
- Tribal leaders stream into Kabul, the Afghan capital, for the inauguration of an interim government that they hope will bring "lasting peace" to a nation torn apart by decades of war.
- Kenton Keith, a former U.S. ambassador to Qatar, says about 7,000 people suspected of having ties to the Taliban and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network are being held and interrogated in Afghanistan.
- The Bush administration says it did not deliberately omit details in its translation of a videotaped conversation between Osama bin Laden and several allies. New translations of the tape, which was released last week, reveal that bin Laden speaks the names of several Sept. 11 hijackers.
- U.S. warplanes attack a convoy that the Pentagon says was carrying Taliban or al-Qaida leaders in Afghanistan. But an Afghan official says the trucks were bringing tribal leaders loyal to the new government to the capital.
- President Bush says Osama bin Laden may "slither out" of Afghanistan, but he won't escape the global reach of U.S. forces. He says the United States would send troops to nations seeking help to hunt down terrorists.
