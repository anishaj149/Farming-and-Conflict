A key element of the first phase of the "road map" peace plan at the center of Wednesday's Mideast summit in Aqaba, Jordan, is removal of Israeli settlement outposts created since March 1, 2001. Some details about the outposts:
- The Peace Now group, which opposes Jewish settlement in the West Bank, says that 117 unauthorized outposts have been created since 1998, 62 of them since the March 1 date.
Israel's Defense Ministry says there are about 100 outposts, a figure also used by U.S. officials.
- Some of the outposts consist of no more than a few trailers or an antenna, and many are positioned on hilltops. Some are unpopulated; most have fewer than a dozen settlers. About 700 Israelis live in the outposts, according to estimates.
- For several months, the Israeli Defense Ministry has said it is studying the issue of the outposts' legality. After the Aqaba summit, a ministry official said the study, headed by Ron Schechner, the minister's adviser on settlement, should be completed in a few weeks. The official would not say how many of the outposts are likely to be deemed illegal.
- Israeli officials say some outposts serve a security function - for example, protecting roads - and these should stay.
- Many other Israelis say the illegal outposts get in the way of a deal that could unburden their country of the costly occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
- About 230,000 Israelis live in 150 veteran West Bank and Gaza settlements created with the approval of Israeli governments since the late 1960s. Palestinians consider all of them illegal encroachment on land they claim for a state. However, they see the outposts as special provocations.
