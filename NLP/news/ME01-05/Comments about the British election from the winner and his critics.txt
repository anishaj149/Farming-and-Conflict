What Tony Blair and others had to say after he won a historic third term as Britain's prime minister but his Labour Party suffered a sharply reduced parliamentary majority because of the unpopularity of his support for the Iraq war:
---
"I know Iraq has been a divisive issue in this country, but I hope now that we can unite again and look to the future there and here." - Blair.
---
"It's clear … that the British people wanted the return of a Labour government but with a reduced majority, and we have to respond to that sensibly and wisely and responsibly." - Blair.
---
"To be re-elected for a third time is very special, so it's a tremendous privilege and an honor. Let's make sure we use it now for the good of our country." - Blair.
---
"I think it is going to be a very different House of Commons from the one we have had over the past eight years, and I think that is going to be very healthy, whatever people's political views." - Liberal Democrat party leader Charles Kennedy.
---
"This election marks a real advance towards our recovery. The task which faces us in the next Parliament is to complete that recovery." - Conservative Party leader Michael Howard.
---
"Now I can go to my son's grave with my head held high and say, 'At least I tried."' - Reg Keys, whose son died in Iraq and who unsuccessfully sought to take Blair's seat.
---
"Mr. Blair, this is for Iraq. This defeat that you have suffered and all the other defeats that New Labour has suffered this evening is for Iraq. All the people you killed, all the lies you told, have come back to haunt you. And the best thing the Labour Party could do is sack you tomorrow morning." - George Galloway, expelled from Labour and re-elected to Parliament on anti-war ticket.
---
"Our purpose will be to maintain and entrench our economic stability and prosperity, … and to build a stronger, fairer Britain where every child has the best start in life and there is dignity, security and opportunity for every family in the country. This is the work that drives us on, this is the vision that gives enduring purpose to what we do, this is the task our party wants to take forward starting from this morning." - Treasury chief Gordon Brown.
