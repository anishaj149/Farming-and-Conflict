Some comments from Army Gen. Tommy Franks, the four-star Army general who would lead a U.S. war on Iraq.
-On the possibility that Saddam Hussein is preparing to concentrate his defenses inside Baghdad and force the United States to fight an urban war:
"I have not seen that but I think all of us recognize that he has that option."
-On the need to take military action against Iraq:
"I believe that he (Saddam Hussein) possesses weapons of mass destruction. And I believe that the course of action available to us needs to be a different course of action than the one we have been on for lo these number of years" since the Gulf War.
-On the likelihood that Iraq would use a weapon of mass destruction against U.S. forces.
"I am sure that part of the calculus of our nation involves how to deter that, I would be sure.
-On the outlook for U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan:
"We're going to cointinue military operations for the foreseeable future."
"Having destroyed all the terrorist infrastructure in Afghanistan, what we want to be sure of is that we do not leave a condition inside Afghanistan where terrorism and terrorist training camps and so forth can be reintroduced."
