French Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said Friday investigators found traces of TNT on the French oil tanker that exploded in what authorities believe was a terrorist attack.
Specialists from France, Yemen and the United States have been trying to determine what caused the Sunday blast and fire on the Limburg, which killed one crew member and loosed 90,000 barrels of oil into the Gulf of Aden.
American officials said Sunday's blast was an act of terrorism most likely carried out by people with links to al-Qaida, the terror network led by Osama bin Laden and blamed in the Sept. 11 attacks.
France has not said whom it believes was responsible, but the Foreign Ministry said Thursday that investigators believed the attack was deliberate.
"The initial results of the inquiry carried out by French, Yemeni and American investigators suggest the explosion Oct. 6 on board the French oil tanker, the Limburg, was due to an attack," a ministry statement said.
