A look at some of the steps that will soon follow under the resolution on post-war Iraq approved Thursday by the U.N. Security Council. The resolution lifts sanctions that were imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and authorizes Britain and the United States to run Iraq:
- Iraq can resume oil exports which were halted shortly before the war. There are 8 million barrels of Iraqi oil in storage tanks at the Turkish port of Ceyhan, one of Iraq's two export terminals, that can be sold immediately, diplomats said.
- Foreign governments and companies are now free to trade and invest in Iraq. An arms embargo institute in 1990 will remain in place.
- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will appoint a special representative to work with U.S. and British administrators on humanitarian assistance, reconstruction and the creation of a new representative Iraqi government. Speculation for Annan's choice centered on U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello of Brazil, who has Washington's support.
- A newly created Development Fund for Iraq at Iraq's central bank will start receiving proceeds from oil sales. The United States and Britain will be in charge of using the fund to rebuild the country. A new advisory and monitoring body including the United Nations and international financial institutions will be created to oversee the fund. It will get a $1 billion deposit, transferred from the U.N. oil-for-food account.
- Goverments must freeze Iraqi assets belonging to Saddam Hussein or his government and transfer them to the fund unless they are subject to legal claims.
- The oil-for-food program will be phased out over the next six months. Annan will review $10 billion worth of contracts existing under the program to decide whether they are still needed. These contracts, many of them with Russian companies, range from food and medicine to plumbing and sanitation equipment, oil spare parts, and trucks.
- The resolution grants immunity from lawsuits involving future oil and natural gas sales until Dec. 31, 2007, to allow Iraq temporary relief from paying its estimated $400 billion debt and time to restructure the debt.
