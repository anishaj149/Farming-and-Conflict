Iran on Monday lowered the death toll in last year's devastating earthquake by more than one-third to 26,271.
Government officials had previously said that more than 41,000 people died in the magnitude 6.6 quake that hit the southeastern city of Bam.
But the head of the State Statistics Center Abbas Ali Zaali said Monday that 26,271 people died in the temblor, which flattened most of the city on Dec. 26, state radio reported.
"A big reason for this discrepancy is that some of the dead were counted twice due to the confusion and disorder following the quake," the radio quoted Zaali as saying.
He said February's census found 103,516 people to be living in Bam and surrounding villages. At the time of the quake, officials worked off the previous census, which gave Bam's population as 142,376.
Zaali said 525 people were still listed as missing from the quake, and more than 9,000 people were injured.
