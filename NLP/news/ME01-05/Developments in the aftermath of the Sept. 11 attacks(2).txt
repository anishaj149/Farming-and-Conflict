Developments on Tuesday related to the Sept. 11 attacks:
 
- The Bush administration will charge American Taliban John Walker Lindh with conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens in Afghanistan and will ask for life imprisonment rather than the death penalty, Attorney General John Ashcroft said.
- Fifteen servicemen wounded in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan were awarded Purple Hearts. The 13 Army special forces soldiers and two Air Force special operations airmen were hurt in Kandahar or during an uprising by Taliban prisoners at a fortress outside Mazar-e-Sharif.
- American troops captured seven new prisoners in the war in Afghanistan as they pressed ahead with the hunt for hiding al-Qaida terrorists and Taliban leaders.
- Afghanistan's interim administration is desperate for funds, with no money in the bank and no money to pay salaries, the United Nations said. The financial struggles threaten the administration's existence, a U.N. spokesman said. Rebuilding Afghanistan is expected to cost $15 billion during the next 10 years.
- Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld defended his decision not to send a large U.S. ground force to hunt down Osama bin Laden as al-Qaida fighters made a final stand in eastern Afghanistan last month. That would only have hastened a bin Laden escape, Rumsfeld said.
- An American was kidnapped in Afghanistan last week while delivering medical supplies, his wife told government officials. The man was identified as Clark Russell Bowers, 37, of Harvest, Ala.
- The U.N. Security Council lifted an international flight ban on Afghanistan's airline imposed in 1999 in hopes of pressuring the Taliban to hand over bin Laden.
- The Postal Service is planning to increase its reward in the anthrax-by-mail attacks to around $2 million.
- Two men taken off a train a day after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because they were carrying box cutters and hair dye have been indicted on federal charges of credit card fraud.
