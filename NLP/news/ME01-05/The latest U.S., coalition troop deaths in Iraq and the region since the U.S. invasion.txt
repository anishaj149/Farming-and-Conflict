The Department of Defense and family members have identified 389 U.S. servicemembers who died supporting U.S.-led operations in Iraq. Of these, 251 died on or after May 1, when President Bush declared that major combat operations there had ended.
The total of 389 includes accidental and non-combat related deaths. Other U.S. deaths have been reported but have not yet been identified.
