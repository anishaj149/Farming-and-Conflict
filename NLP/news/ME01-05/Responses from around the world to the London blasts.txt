Here are some responses from around the world to the explosions in London:
-UNITED STATES: The terror alert was raised to code orange for U.S. mass transit systems. President Bush conferred in a secure video conference with national security and homeland security officials in Washington. Bush said he urged caution "as our folks start heading to work."
-RUSSIA: Russian authorities ordered stepped-up security measures for Moscow's underground transportation system. President Vladimir Putin said the London attacks showed the world was insufficiently united in the fight against terrorism.
-EUROPEAN UNION: EU legislators called on members of the 25-nation bloc to step up cooperation against terrorism and offered help to Britain in coordinating emergency response to the bombings. The bombers struck "at the very heart of Europe," EU Justice and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini said.
-UNITED NATIONS: The U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a resolution condemning the London terrorist attacks. The British-drafted resolution expressed sympathy for the victims of the four blasts and urged all nations to help bring those responsible to justice and expresses the council's determination to combat terrorism.
-SPAIN: Spain, which suffered a terror attack last year, put its security forces on maximum alert, posting army and police units to watch over shopping centers, transport hubs, sports events and emblematic areas or buildings.
-FRANCE: The French government raised its terror alert level to the second-highest ranking. French President Jacques Chirac said he was horrified by the attacks and called for "more solidarity among the great nations of the world" to combat terror.
-GERMANY: Berlin's transport authority raised its security level to "yellow" - the second of three levels. It also stepped up security patrols in the subway and urged bus and tram drivers to be particularly alert to suspicious objects. In the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the regional government ordered police to step up security at British and U.S. facilities.
-ISRAEL: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called British ambassador Simon McDonald and asked him to convey his shock at "this terrible crime" and the condolences of the people of Israel to the people of Britain.
-INDIA: Call centers in India, where a significant number of Britain's National Rail telephone queries are handled, brought in extra staff and asked some to work overtime as the number of calls doubled after the explosions.
