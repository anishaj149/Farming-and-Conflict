A Polish political party said Saturday it has exclusive rights to promote its candidate with the "President 2000" slogan - and will sue anybody else who uses it in this year's race.
Stanislaw Michalkiewicz, one of the leaders of the rightist Unia Polityki Realnej, or Union for Real Policy, said the party filed for the trademark last year.
"It has not been registered yet, nevertheless it already entitles us to exclusive use," Michalkiewicz said.
The Union, a staunch advocate of radical free market reforms, did not gain any seats in the last parliamentary elections but intends to put forward its candidate in the presidential race this year. Janusz Korwin-Mikke, known for his sense of humor and desire to reduce taxes to a bare minimum, has already run twice for president without success.
President Aleksander Kwasniewski, an ex-communist who leads opinion polls with some 70 percent support, has said he will stand for re-election.
Former president Lech Walesa, legendary founder of the Solidarity movement that toppled communist rule, plans to challenge Kwasniewski. Another candidate is centrist Andrzej Olechowski, who has served as finance minister and foreign minister.
Presidential elections are scheduled for fall, but no specific date has been set.
