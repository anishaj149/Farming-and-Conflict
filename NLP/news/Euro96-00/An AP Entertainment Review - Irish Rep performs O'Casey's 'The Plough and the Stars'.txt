The Irish Repertory Theater is working wonders on its cozy off-Broadway stage, presenting Sean O'Casey's "The Plough and the Stars" and transporting the audience to Dublin in the winter of 1915 and the spring of 1916.
The Irish Citizen Army is meeting in November and fighting the English during Easter week.
O'Casey shows, with deep understanding and compassion, the effect of those events on people who aren't fighting yet but who are hearing guns right outside their tenement house.
The actors, directed by Charlotte Moore, play with a naturalness which makes them become the people they portray.
A difference of opinion usually triggers an instant desire for a fist fight, which the actors - male and female - swing into with gusto. Con Horgan may have a small part as a bartender but he gets plenty of exercise, stepping between and pulling apart combatants.
Louise Favier is Nora, the bride who loses her wits after her young husband (Paul McGrane) goes to fight.
In the last act, Nora keeps walking in front of a window in Bessie Burgess' upstairs flat, a dangerous thing to do because soldiers are shooting at shapes which might be snipers. Set designer Akira Yoshimura has created an amazing sense of upstairs.
And Pauline Flanagan, with her Irish-red hair and strong theatrical presence, makes the independent Bessie indelible.
