What the parties to the Kosovo conflict are demanding:
SERBS
They demand Kosovo province stay part of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, and that no NATO troops enter the country to implement a political settlement. The Serbs will allow some degree of autonomy for Kosovo if Serbia remains the ultimate authority, with the Serbian constitutional court the final arbiter and Serbian police and military providing security.
KOSOVO ALBANIANS
With Serbs forcing thousands of ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo and reports that some of their leaders may be dead, their situation has changed dramatically since NATO airstrikes began. However, most Kosovo Albanians still want an international ground force and freedom from Serb rule, either as an independent state or a separate republic in Yugoslavia. Before airstrikes, moderates won over hard-liners, including the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, by getting the entire ethnic Albanian delegation to sign the Rambouillet peace agreement. With Serbian approval, it would have given Kosovo autonomy for at least three years instead of independence, with NATO troops providing security.
NATO
It demands an end to the Serb offensive in Kosovo, a withdrawal of most Serb and Yugoslav forces from the region, the disarmament of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, and permission for refugees to return to their homes. It also demands that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accept an agreement based on the principles of the Rambouillet agreement - autonomy for Kosovo for at least three years with an international force to provide security. Rambouillet called for 28,000 NATO troops - including 4,000 Americans - on the ground.
