After six years of waiting, Russia was initiated Friday as an equal partner at the summit of industrialized nations, completing an improbable journey from the era when the Soviet Union was the primary antagonist of summit policies.
President Clinton called it a "hopeful moment for the world," and praised Boris Yeltsin for his "vision and persistence" in pursuing democracy and reforms after seven decades of Communism.
Russia also won another eagerly sought prize: membership in a Paris-based group of wealthy countries that sets debt terms for poor countries. The United States hailed the step as tantamount to "the financial end of the Cold War." Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky called it "a morning blessing" after all-night negotiations in New York.
"What you see here is a sweeping integration of Russia into the major decision-making institutions in the world in a way that is very positive for the rest of us," Clinton said as leaders of eight summit nations began their three-day summit with an opening banquet.
The shaky peace in Bosnia was at the center of opening talks. Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi voiced concern about the potential for renewed conflict if terms of the Dayton peace accord are not fully implemented. The country remains split in two, with little real integration between the Serb and the Muslim-Croat controlled areas.
Responding to leaders' concerns that U.S. peacekeeping troops were due to quit Bosnia next summer, Clinton said the focus was misplaced and that they should concentrate on accelerating the return of refugees, formation of local police forces and holding elections.
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto sought and won the leaders' support for sending an envoy to look into the violence and political turmoil in Cambodia.
In the afternoon, Clinton and Yeltsin met at the Brown Palace hotel where a buzz broke out among sightseers at the approach of Yeltsin's motorcade. The Russian president stepped from his limousine as the crowd began snapping photographs and chanting "Boris! Boris!"
He told Clinton he had lost more than 60 pounds after last year's heart attack and that his suits were baggy. "My brain is always moving fast," Yeltsin remarked, "but now my body is also moving with more energy."
Clinton's day was diverted by the announcement of a landmark tobacco regulation settlement. While saying tobacco companies had made concessions once unimaginable, Clinton did not endorse the agreement, saying the administration would have to review it.
Following private meetings among the leaders, the 23rd annual summit began with a courtyard reception at the colonial mansion of Gov. Roy Romer. After admiring French tapestries and 16th century carvings, the leaders were sitting down for dinner - lobster consomme, spring vegetable and lamb - to talk about international developments, particularly the fragile Bosnian peace accords.
Yeltsin was asked to lead off the discussion with Clinton and leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. The group had been known as G-7 but Clinton renamed its meeting "Summit of The Eight."
Yeltsin's inclusion was both a symbolic and substantive gesture of support for Russia's reforms and its desire to participate in international economic and political institutions.
It also gave a big dose of international prestige to the Russian leader, who was almost written off as a political relic last year after a heart attack and widespread doubts about his leadership. With Russia joining the summit, Clinton said, "It's quite a hopeful moment for the world, I think, and I give him a lot of credit…
Mikhail Gorbachev, president of what was then the Soviet Union, came to London in 1991 to meet with the western leaders but they made a point of not including him in summit discussions. Russian leaders have attended the meeting each year since in a slowly expanding role.
"This is the first time we've ever had a meeting where the Russians were here from the beginning to the end. It's a great tribute I think to President Yeltsin's leadership and to the commitment of the Russian people to democracy and reform."
Yeltsin and Clinton announced that Russia was being admitted to the so-called Paris Club, a group of wealthy countries that negotiates debt terms with developing nations. Inclusion will give Russia greater bargaining power for collecting at least a portion of the $ 120 billion it has loaned to poorer countries.
The two leaders also discussed their arms control agenda but skirted over the touchy subject of NATO expansion, which Yeltsin opposes.
U.S. officials said Clinton expressed concern about a law pending in the Russian Duma to require registration of religious groups. Clinton said it could cause problems with free expression of religion. Yeltsin said he understood Clinton's concern and would look into it, U.S. officials said.
Away from the summit, leaders took the opportunity to meet among themselves. After a session with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Yeltsin grinned and said, "I think we need to improve our personal contact and I'm glad you're of the same opinion. … I'm distressed that our relations are not at the needed level.
Russia and Japan have had a long-running territorial dispute over the Russian-held Kuril islands. Hashimoto had said he would press for an early solution. But Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the two leaders did not specifically discuss the matter.
"We cannot expect to solve this problem today or tomorrow or in the near future," a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
Clinton met French President Jacques Chirac and Prodi of Italy - both unhappy with Clinton's insistence on limiting new membership in NATO to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
Chirac pressed to include Romania but Clinton did not budge. Prodi wants to include Slovenia in NATO.
Discussing plans for the NATO summit, a U.S. official said Clinton is considering extending his travels in Europe next month after the July 8-9 meeting in Madrid - and Poland appeared to be one possible stop. Yeltsin told Clinton he would not go to Madrid but would send high level representatives.
