Events around the world Thursday as the United Nations celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
 
 -CHINA: President Jiang Zemin promised to protect the rights and freedoms of China's citizens. Police ransacked the homes of at least six dissidents in a widening clampdown on political dissent.
-INDONESIA: Thousands of angry students demanding greater democracy and human rights hurled stones and bottles at Jakarta's police headquarters in a show of discontent with the pace of political reform.
-BULGARIA: Parliament abolished capital punishment and replaced it with life imprisonment without parole in a measure to move its legal system closer to European standards.
-PHILIPPINES: President Joseph Estrada ordered a special committee to review all the cases of people jailed for politically related crimes and recommend those who should be released.
-PAKISTAN: Dozens of Afghan women protested outside U.N. offices, accusing successive leaders of the country of "savagely assaulting the rights" of women and attacking the rules imposed by the Taliban religious army that prevent women from working or attending school.
-INDIA: Groups representing Indians once known as "untouchable" began a campaign to end discrimination based on caste, which is illegal but entrenched by tradition.
-SOUTH AFRICA: The government announced that it would ratify several U.N. human rights conventions on civil and political rights, the elimination of all forms of racial or degrading treatment or punishment and the prevention and punishment of genocide.
-FRANCE: In a seven-hour megaconcert, rock singers Peter Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, and others feted the anniversary of the human rights charter before 15,000 cheering fans. The concert was organized in honor of the declaration, signed in Paris 50 years ago.
