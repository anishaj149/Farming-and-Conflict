Chancellor Helmut Kohl says no.
The man who has been at the helm of Germany's government for 16 years has rejected any strategy that would have him hand over his party's candidacy to his heir-apparent before the Sept. 27 national election.
Faced with discouraging polls and a recent state election defeat, some members of Kohl's party have pushed for a campaign that raises the profile of Kohl's protege, 55-year-old Wolfgang Schaeuble. Industry leaders have backed the "tandem" approach for Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
Kohl said Tuesday he would campaign alongside Schaeuble, the party's leader in Parliament, but he would not - "not even eventually" - withdraw as its candidate for chancellor.
Kohl, who spoke after meeting with party representatives from eastern Germany, said the country's record postwar unemployment would be a key campaign issue.
Lower Saxony Gov. Gerhard Schroeder is Kohl's challenger from the opposition Social Democrats, and his home-state triumph earlier this month gave the Socialists momentum in the polls.
