Self-described "British export" Jane Seymour had a homecoming to relish Thursday when she was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.
Seymour was honored by the queen at a Buckingham Palace ceremony, then celebrated with a spin on the giant new Millennium Wheel and a boat party on the Thames.
"This will be a day to remember," said the star of the U.S. television show "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman."
"Having spent as much time as I have abroad - but always loving England - it was very special to be honored by my own country and especially by the queen," said the actress, who has homes in Bath, England, and in Malibu, Calif.
"I have always thought that I was in some way a British export," she added.
