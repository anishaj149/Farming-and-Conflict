Chancellor Helmut Kohl may be trailing in his bid for re-election, but there's one race where he's way ahead: the garden gnome hit parade.
According to statistics presented Friday by the German Garden Gnome Museum, Kohl's portly figure is the basis for 14 versions of the popular kitschy statuettes, some plaster, some plastic and in all sorts of colors.
In second place with six versions is Kohl's short and plump labor minister, Norbert Bluem, who confessed: "I'm my own favorite garden gnome."
Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democrat who lost to Kohl in the 1994 election, has four versions of himself. This year's opposition candidate, Gerhard Schroeder, has only one.
