Taking time out from annual carnival celebrations, voters in Liechtenstein elected a new 25-head parliament to guide the tiny principality through the next four years.
Sunday's election led to no real changes in power.
The Fatherland Union retained its majority in parliament with 13 seats - the same as in last elections. The rival Progressive People's Party won 11 seats, one less than in 1993.
The two main parties have similar platforms and have shared power since 1938. The leftist Green List - the only real opposition - gained one seat for a total of two in the new parliament.
Mario Frick, the 32-year-old prime minister, will continue to head the government.
Absolute power - if he chooses to wield it - rests with Prince Hans Adam II. The prince has helped ease Liechtenstein out of the shadow of neighboring Switzerland and into closer European ties. Unlike Switzerland, it is a member of a vast European free trade pact but there are no plans for it to join the European Union.
Liechtenstein, with just 30,000 residents, retains an old-fashioned charm: The capital, Vaduz, has no railway station and only one set of traffic lights. Nearly 87 percent of the electorate voted, turning out at the polls as they attended the yearly carnival parade.
