You watched the scenery in that hit British film or television show. Now, the British Tourist Authority wants you to visit the location.
The authority's "Movie Map," a guide to filming locations, was such a success when it first was introduced three years ago that an updated version has just been published, including such entries as "Shakespeare in Love," "The Full Monty" and "Notting Hill."
The map, which pinpoints 110 locations for 67 films and TV shows, has been translated into French, Spanish, Italian and Japanese.
The tourist authority notes that use of locations often leads to a substantial increase in visitors and a boost to the local economy.
Osborne House on the Isle Of Wight, for example, has seen a 25 percent increase in visitors since it was featured in "Mrs. Brown." And there now is a popular "Full Monty" tour in the northern town of Sheffield.
"Promoting British film and TV locations gets our overseas visitors really exploring the country," said David Quarmby, the tourist authority's chairman. "It reinforces the images of Britain as a fascinating, immensely diverse and richly rewarding tourism destination."
