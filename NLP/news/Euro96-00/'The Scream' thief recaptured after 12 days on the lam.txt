The man who stole "The Scream" may be a master thief, but he is not a master of disguise.
After escaping from prison on Feb. 10, Paal Enger was captured Monday after wearing sunglasses late at night, which attracted attention.
Enger, 31, escaped while on an outing from the minimum-security prison where he was serving a six-year sentence for the bold 1994 theft of Norwegian Edvard Munch's painting "The Scream."
He was recaptured at the train station in Moss, 30 miles south of Oslo.
"The Scream," which shows a ghastly figure standing on a bridge, clasping its head against the background of a lurid sky, is considered a Norwegian national treasure. Many were shocked when it was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo.
The painting was recovered undamaged three months later in a sting operation that included assistance from Scotland Yard. Enger was one of four people convicted in the theft.
Enger's escape irritated police and prison inmates alike, since he was serving his term in an open facility and could have walked out at any time. Fellow inmates said that by breaking an unwritten prison rule by escaping during an outing, he could cost other prisoners that privilege.
The convicted thief also tormented police by turning up in a cafe frequented by celebrities in Oslo, and granting television and newspaper interviews while on the run.
Enger is now likely to be moved to a full-security prison.
