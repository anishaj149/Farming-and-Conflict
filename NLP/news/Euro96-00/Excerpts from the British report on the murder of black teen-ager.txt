Excerpts from the report by Sir William Macpherson on the official inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the subsequent failure of police investigations:
---
"The investigation was marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior officers. A flawed … review failed to expose these inadequacies. The second investigation could not salvage the faults of the first investigation."
---
"No police officer did anything by way of first aid, apart from the small amount of testing to see whether Stephen Lawrence was still breathing and whether his pulse was beating (on the night of April 22)."
---
"We were astonished at the lack of direction and organization during the vital first hours after the murder. Almost total lack of proper documentation makes reconstruction of what happened during those hours difficult. But lack of imagination and properly coordinated action and planning which might have led to the discovery and arrest of suspects was conspicuous by its absence. No officers early on the scene took any proper steps at once to pursue the suspects. There were large numbers of police officers available, but inadequate measures were taken to use them actively and properly."
---
"From the first contact with police officers at the hospital, and thereafter, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence were treated with insensitivity and lack of sympathy. … They were patronized. They were never given information about the investigation to which they were entitled.
---
A vital and fundamental mistake was made in failing to arrest the suspects named in that information by the morning of 26 April."
---
"When the arrests were made on 7 May it is plain that the searches of all the suspects' premises were inadequate. Information expressly suggested that knives might be concealed under floorboards. There is no evidence that a single floorboard was removed during any of the searches."
---
"There can be no excuses for such a series of errors, failures, and lack of direction and control. Each failure was compounded. Failure to acknowledge and to detect errors resulted in them being effectively concealed. Only now at this Inquiry have they been laid bare."
---
"We do believe that institutional racism is apparent in those areas described. But we do not accept that it was universally the cause of the failure of this investigation, any more than we accept that a finding of institutional racism within the police service means that all officers are racist."
---
"There is a striking and inescapable need to demonstrate fairness, not just by police services, but across the criminal justice system as a whole, in order to generate trust and confidence within minority ethnic communities, who undoubtedly perceive themselves to be discriminated against by 'the system'."
