Sicily's hamlet of the "boss of bosses" is breaking the golden Mafia rule: It's talking about it.
And, starting in December, it's showcasing it - opening a Mafia documentation center that will allow scholars, law enforcement agencies and the general public to study organized crime.
"This culture of the word will fight the culture of silence," proclaimed Pippo Cipriani, mayor of this tiny hillside town near Palermo.
"Omerta," or the code of silence, is the fundamental Mafia rule. Breaking it brought death to many here, but it is also the first step in the anti-Mafia fight, and a particularly poignant one in the town that has become a Mafia namesake.
It was from here that Salvatore "Toto" Riina ruled organized crime for 20 years until his arrest in 1993. In "The Godfather" movies, Corleone was the padrino's family name.
"We want people to appreciate the will to speak out, the effort of this village," Cipriani said Friday, adding that his project is not danger-free. "Thus far, it has been relatively quiet, but we'll need to act cautiously - though without fear."
The center, due to open in December in a 17th-century convent, will house documents and videos from Italy's anti-Mafia agencies, the media and private collections.
It will be linked to the University of Palermo and host yearly conferences on the topic of the fight against organized crime. Italy's anti-Mafia commission is providing some of the funding.
"An adequate information center will also be an instrument of fight," Cipriani said.
In the past decade, Italy has seen growing willingness by the public to speak out against the Mafia, and by Mafiosi to turn state's evidence against it.
