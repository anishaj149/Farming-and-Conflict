The beauty and grandeur of California's coastline is displayed on a new 33-cent stamp celebrating the 150th anniversary of that Pacific state into the Union on Sept. 9.
The U.S. Postal Service's new offering features a color photo of cliffs at the southern end of California's Bug Sur coastline.
Iceplant foliage is also part of the design.
California's statehood aspirations moved forward when United States naval and military forces occupied the territory early in a war with Mexico in the mid-1840s. In a treaty at the end of the war, Mexico ceded the province to the United States.
On Jan. 24, 1848, less than 10 days before the signing of the treaty, James W. Marshall discovered gold on the South Fork of the American River at Coloma, northeast of Sacramento. Within a few months, one of the great migrations of all time developed. Between 1848 and 1952, California's population increased from approximately 15,000 to 250,000.
Actually, California initially assumed statehood without federal permission. However, following lengthy debates in Congress, California entered the Union as a free state on Sept. 9, 1850.
The new self-adhesive California sesquicentennial stamp is available in singles or panes of 20 at your local post office. First-day covers may be ordered from the Stamp Fulfillment Services of the Postal Service by calling (800) STAMP-24.
