Comments from both sides of the Atlantic on whether the original Winnie the Pooh and his stuffed friends Eeyore, Kanga, Piglet and Tigger should stay in New York or be returned to England:
 
 ---
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani:
"They are in the capital of the world. They couldn't be in a better place - terrific restaurants, great food, the best theater district in the world."
---
Gwyneth Dunwoody, Labor member of British Parliament:
"We want Winnie the Pooh back - and all his friends. This is where they belong, not in some stuffy glass case in New York."
 
 ---
Malcolm de Selincourt, cousin of the late Christopher Milne, model for Christopher Robin:
"Winnie the Pooh should be in England. His rightful place is here, in the House at Pooh Corner or under the pine trees."
 
 ---
British Prime Minister Tony Blair:
"I'm sure they're perfectly well looked after where they are."
 
 ---
Lindsey O'Neill, 5, a New York kindergartner who held the jar of honey that Giuliani brought to the library for Pooh:
Pooh should return to Britain "because it's a long trip. He started there and he came here and he should go back home."
 
 ---
David Yelland, a Briton and deputy editor of the New York Post:
"I'm sure New Yorkers would happily return Winnie the Pooh if the prime minister agreed to take back the Spice Girls, Liam Gallagher and the Teletubbies."
