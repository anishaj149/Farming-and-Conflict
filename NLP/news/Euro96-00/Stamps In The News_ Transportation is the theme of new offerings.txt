From sailing vessels to Hovercraft, from zeppelins to supersonic jet planes, and from buses to bullet trains, various means of transportation have traversed the centuries.
It's all portrayed on a series of stamps with the theme "Transportation" issued by the United Nations Postal Administration.
There are 15 stamps in the set. Five are 32-cent U.S. denomination. Five are 70 franc Swiss denomination. Five are 7 schilling Austrian.
The U.S. denomination stamps feature watercraft - a clipper ship, a sail and steam-powered ocean crossing ship of the 1800s, an ocean liner of the 1900s, a Hovercraft and a hydrofoil developed in the 1960s.
The Swiss stamps show aircraft - a zeppelin, the flying boat of the 1930s, the DeHavilland jet of the 1950s, the Boeing Jumbo Jet and the French supersonic Concorde.
The Austrian stamps depict land transportation - a 1901 automobile, a double-decker bus with a trailer truck in the background, a streetcar, an 1829 railway engine, and a high-speed electrically powered train, sometimes referred to as a bullet train.

Beautiful post offices
Great Britain's Royal Mail pays tribute to "four of the most beautiful and unique post offices in the United Kingdom." The quartet of stamps celebrate 100 years of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters whose members serve as the hub of local communities.
The 20 pence shows the Haroldswitch office on the Shetland Island of Unst, Britain's most northerly post office. The 26 pence depicts the Painswick office in Gloucestershire, the oldest post office building in Britain. The 43 pence features the Beddgelert post office with its picturesque solid stone edifice. The 63-pence illustrates the Ballyroney post office, southeast of Newry in Northern Ireland.
