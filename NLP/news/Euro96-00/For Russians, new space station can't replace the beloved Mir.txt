After years of cosmic misfortune, could there actually be a flash of good news coming from Russia's sputtering space program?
On Friday, Russia plans to launch the first leg of the biggest space project ever - the International Space Station, which is designed to serve as man's home away from the home planet for the next two decades.
The new station should be a godsend for the impoverished Russians, masters of long-term space flight. Russia gets to play a central role in the premier manned space venture at the dawn of the 21st century, while most of the money comes from the 15 other participating nations - the United States, Canada, Japan and 12 European states.
Yet Russia's beleaguered space professionals, who have endured deep funding cuts, failed rocket launches and several near disasters on the Mir, can't seem to shake that hangdog look.
They remain hopelessly enthralled with the Mir, that smelly, leaky, fire-singed bucket-of-bolts that has made 70,000 loops around the Earth over the past 12 years.
And when the new station goes up, their venerated Mir is supposed to come down.
"There was euphoria when the Mir was launched," said Viktor Blagov, the deputy flight controller at Russia's Mission Control ever since the Mir was sent up in 1986. "We don't have that same feeling now. Nobody in Russia wants to see the Mir de-orbited."
Russia can no longer afford a space station, let alone two. And NASA says the price for participating in the new station is to discard the Mir, which is supposed to vanish into the Pacific Ocean around the middle of next year if all goes as planned.
Plans aren't etched in stone, however. An aide to President Boris Yeltsin, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, raised the possibility on Sunday that the Mir might stay in orbit until the end of 1999 or early in 2000, possibly even longer.
The Russians insist they are fully committed to the deal. But the new station can only replace the Mir in orbit, not in their hearts.
"The Mir is old, but it could stay up for five more years," said cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyov, who must surely know as much about the station as anyone. A veteran of five Mir missions, his most recent sojourn ended in February after he performed several spacewalks to patch up some of the station's most serious problems.
Russia's emotional attachment to the Mir may seem odd to outsiders, who consider it the orbital equivalent of a rusting jalopy. But through Russian eyes, the Mir has been an unequaled success.
Expected to last just five years, it has demonstrated the feasibility of long-term human habitation in space, taught crews how to improvise during extended journeys, and served as the model for many aspects of the new space station.
When the Mir is gone, the Russians will be without a major space project of their own for the first time in decades. And playing second fiddle to the Americans won't come easy to a country that put the first satellite in orbit and the first man in space.
For both Americans and Russians, this transition from the space race to a celestial embrace requires all sorts of compromises their space agencies have never had to make before.
The Mir and the U.S. space shuttle have both handled international crews, and while these efforts were successes, they also highlighted national differences over what is safe and what isn't.
When the Mir suffered a string of accidents last year, the Americans expressed skepticism about its safety and debated the wisdom of sending up another astronaut.
The Russians, meanwhile, noted the Mir had been afflicted by more than 1,500 breakdowns during its lifetime and said the latest problems, like earlier ones, could be fixed without endangering the crew.
No single country will be completely in charge of the new station, making it a mini-United Nations in orbit that will require equal measures of diplomacy in space and on the ground.
A few examples:
-The cash-strapped Russians have repeatedly missed deadlines on building the key service module, which will house the first crew. Washington keeps putting up extra money, but some U.S. congressmen are agitated over Russia's poky pace, which has put the space station a year behind schedule.
-The Russians have the most experienced space fliers, but less experienced Americans will command the crews. The Russians have agreed, reluctantly.
-There will be two mission control centers - the main one in Houston, a backup in Moscow. But the Russians have been pushing for more control over their equipment and their cosmonauts.
The new station is essentially a bigger, better Mir, but it won't be crossing any space frontiers. Like Mir, it will endlessly circle the Earth, and critics joke that its mission is to boldly go where man has gone so many times before.
Friday's liftoff from Baikonur in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan will send up an unmanned propulsion component. The space shuttle Endeavor is to carry the Americans' first segment - a connecting passageway - into space Dec. 3.
The first crews won't board the station until late 1999 or early 2000, after Russia's behind-schedule service module is in place.
Some think those dates are overly optimistic.
"Awarding the Russians such a large role appears to be a decision that was driven by politics, rather than by space engineering," said Geoff Perry, head of Kettering Space Observers Group in Britain and a leading expert on the Russian space program. "It's risky putting the Russians in charge of such critical elements, because if they fail, it will set the entire program back."
There's even speculation the Russians are secretly pleased with the delays, because it will allow them to keep the Mir aloft longer. The Russians adamantly deny this.
The Russians say they have earned their role through years of long-term space missions. In fact, the Russians balked several times when they thought they were not receiving their due.
"When the Americans suggested they control everything from Houston, we were not in agreement," Blagov said in an interview at Russia's Mission Control in suburban Moscow. "Why should we go there when we have everything here?"
Asked what he will do once the Mir is brought down, Blagov, a 39-year veteran of the space program, offered a wry smile and said, "I will work with the Mir until I die with the station."
