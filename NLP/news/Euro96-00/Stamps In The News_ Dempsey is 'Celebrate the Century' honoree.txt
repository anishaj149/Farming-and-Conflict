Much publicity has been given by the U.S. Postal Service to the issuance of the first 30 stamps in its "Celebrate the Century" program.
In February, the U.S. Postal Service issued two sheets of stamps commemorating the 1900s and 1910s which were released one per day. Two collectible sheets of 15 commemorative stamps - one for 1901-1909 and the other for 1910-1919 - were made available to the public.
The purpose of the program, say Postal Service officials, is to honor the most memorable and significant people, places and events of each decade of the 20th century. Subject matter for the first five decades are already programmed. But the public will vote for the subjects for the last 50 years. Ballots are available at your local post offices.
The pair of commemorative sheets (15 each) are also available at your local post offices. Such notable events of the first decade as the Wright Brothers' first flight in 1903 are depicted. Also seen is the first World Series in 1903 and the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair.
The second sheet illustrations include boxing's Jack Dempsey winning the world heavyweight championship in 1919, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the opening of the Grand Canyon National Park in 1919.
The sheets of 15 cost $ 4.80 each. First-day covers cost $ 6.80. For further information, call (800) STAMP-24.

Canada honors 1948 Olympic winners
The 1998 Winter Olympics are history. But Canada is looking back 50 years to the 1948 Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland, to honor its medal-winning athletes.
Canada has released a special souvenir envelope featuring its ice rink heroes of a half century ago.
The highlight was the gold medal performance of figure skater Barbara Ann Scott on a rough outdoor ice rink. Pairs skaters Suzanne Morrow and Wally Distelmeyer won a bronze medal in a blinding snowstorm.
Canada's most inspiring triumph came from the Royal Canadian Air Force hockey team. The tournament underdogs went unbeaten in eight games to win the gold medal.
The envelope bears the 45-cent commemorative stamp issued in 1997 depicting the 1972 "Series of the Century."
The souvenir envelopes are available by mail order from the National Philatelic Centre, 75 St. Ninian St., Antigonish, Nova Scotia B2G 2R8. Or you may call (800) 565-4362.
