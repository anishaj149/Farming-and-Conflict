The American skyscraper motivated a young immigrant to write a great American novel.
The immigrant was Ayn Rand. The novel was the "The Fountainhead."
Now Rand is honored with a 33-cent U.S. commemorative stamp in the American Literary Arts series. Her novel, published in 1943 and made into a movie in 1949 starring Gary Cooper, was the story of a dedicated architect who focused on building skyscrapers.
The new stamp features an art deco style reminiscent of The Fountainhead era of the 1920s. Rand, who became a U.S. citizen, was born Alissa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia. Her portrait appears in the center of the stamp, her name above.
Other honorees in the American Literary Arts series have been Stephen Vincent Benet, Thornton Wilder, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tennessee Williams, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck.
First day of issue postmarks of the Rand stamp are available by mail: Buy the stamp at your local post office, affix it to a self-addressed envelope and mail it in another envelope to: Ayn Rand Stamp, Postmaster, Special Events, P.O. Box 2001, JAF Building, New York, N.Y. 10116-2001. Requests must be postmarked by May 22.
