White tulips, lilies and roses graced the top of the Princess of Wales' coffin Saturday, special tokens from Diana's young sons and the Spencer family.
A large spray of white lilies, a traditional flower of mourning, was sent from Diana's brother, sisters and mother.
At the front of the coffin, a tight wreath of white roses bearing a card inscribed simply "Mummy" was from Prince Harry, 12. Tiny white tulips at the back, drawn together with raffia, were from Prince William, 15, the future king.
Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, carried their wreath - also in purest white - to the foot of the catafalque as the coffin lay in Westminster Abbey, to symbolize the tribute of the nation.
Prince Charles and his sons placed another.
The thousands of bouquets carpeting the grounds outside Buckingham Palace will remain on display through the weekend, before they are gathered up by hand, the palace said. All of the messages attached to the flowers will be collected and delivered to Diana's relatives.
