The Freedom Forum marked the coming 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall by dedicating a 32-foot-wide section of it, along with an original guard tower, outside its journalism museum Thursday.
The section outside the Newseum is the largest on display outside Germany, said the Freedom Forum.
At the ceremony, former Secretary of State James Baker remembered rushing from a luncheon with then-Philippine President Corazon Aquino on Nov. 9, 1989, after he heard the borders between East and West Germany had been opened.
"By the time I arrived at the White House to discuss our response with President Bush, CNN was already broadcasting those unforgettable images of young Germans literally chipping away at the Wall," he said.
The watchtower in the exhibition, topped by a searching light, originally was less than a mile from "Checkpoint Charlie," the famous crossing between East and West Berlin. It was one of 300 guard towers standing along the Wall.
"To really understand what was going on in Germany, it is important to know that the wall … was a painful daily reality for the people of Berlin and Germany as a whole," said German Ambassador Jurgen Chrobog. The exhibit "can only give an idea of how oppressive and disturbing this division was."
The exhibition will be part of Freedom Park outside the Newseum, along with items such as the jail door of the cell where Martin Luther King Jr. was held in custody in 1963 and a replica of the Goddess of Democracy, made by plaster and paper by the students on the Tiananmen Square in Beijing during the democracy movement in 1989.
The Newseum will hold a series of programs and exhibitions about the fall of Berlin Wall.
