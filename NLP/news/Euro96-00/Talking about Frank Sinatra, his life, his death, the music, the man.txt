"I think every American would have to smile and say he really did do it his way." - President Clinton.
---
"Today, the sound of heaven's chorus is a little brighter and more beautiful as our dear friend, Frank Sinatra, joins its ranks. Frank's golden gift made him a Hollywood icon. He sang about real people and real emotions; his songs and music transcend age and time. We will never forget when Frank performed at our inaugural celebrations - it made those evenings that much more special to the both of us." - former President Reagan and Nancy Reagan.
---
"He was the epitome of what singing is all about, beautiful sound, smooth as silk, effortless, impeccable phrasing, stylish, intelligent and full of heart." - singer Barbra Streisand.
---
"He was my protector who always stood up for me and he was my father figure. But mostly, he was my hero and my friend." - performer Liza Minnelli.
---
"One of Sinatra's favorite toasts to make with glass in hand was, 'May you live to be 100 and may the last voice you hear be mine.' The master is gone but his voice will live forever." - entertainer Tony Bennett.
---
"He was the first love of my life and he remained a true friend, always there when I needed him. I will miss him more than words can say." - actress Mia Farrow, Sinatra's third wife.
---
"I can't imagine life without Sinatra. … My fondest memory was the laughs we had together." - producer George Schlatter.
---
"They can say what they like, the man was a phenomenal entertainer. He was a one and only. … Even when he had his bad times he was still scrapping away to get back to what he enjoyed most of all and that was entertaining." - singer Frankie Vaughan.
---
"The world has now lost one of the most precious commodities. … In all memories, from childhood to romance to the mature years, Frank has been with us in all times. He gave so much of himself and much more than people realized. It is a sad day today because Frank touched everyone in the world." - actor Ernest Borgnine.
---
"He of course had his talent, his charisma, and his voice, which put rhythm into, accompanied and made our entire era dream. But he also had his personality - warm, passionate." - French President Jacques Chirac.
---
"It's the saddest day of my life." - singer Eydie Gorme.
---
"I would say that half the population of the United States over the age of 40 was conceived while their parents were listening to his records. He played a great romantic role in the country. … Most singers are pretty bland, mellifluous - Bing Crosby put you to sleep, Sinatra got the blood flowing." - writer Gore Vidal.
---
"Frank knew how to do it. Everything. … It humbles me to have been a small part of his gigantic presence." - music producer Quincy Jones.
---
"One of his most famous songs, "New York, New York," is sung at every Yankee game, it's sung all over the place. It's become the theme song, really, for New York. And his rendition of it is the one that's the quintessential rendition of the song." - New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
---
"Frank Sinatra was the 20th century, he was modern, he was complex, he had swing and he had attitude. … He was the big bang of pop … the man invented pop music." - Bono, lead singer of the rock band U2.
---
"He's the greatest singer of popular songs who ever lived. He is quite irreplaceable." - former talkshow host Johnny Carson.
---
"He was representative of a day when American lyrics were coherent and civilized and clever. And when there was glorious melody characterizing most of our popular songs. And he was the No. 1 salesman of that kind of material." - comedian Steve Allen.
---
"You know, he's the idol. … A great Italian American, a great American, and a great actor." - director Martin Scorsese.
---
"We have lost part of our capacity to self-reflect because frank is gone. His music helped us understand our own lives more clearly because he was authentically honest about himself. I am so sad for all of us who are now without him." - actress Shirley MacLaine.
---
"If I'm anything, I'm satisfied with the fact that he's no longer suffering." - Joey Bishop, the last surviving member of the Rat Pack: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Bishop.
