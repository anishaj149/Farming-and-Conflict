It's right there in the sports pages: The United States, Australia, China, France and Russia are on top in winning medals at the Sydney Olympics.
But that's not the only way to look at it.
By the Australian Bureau of Statistics' reckoning, the leaders are Australia, Slovakia, Estonia, Switzerland and Costa Rica.
That's how the competition stacks up when a country's medal total is compared with its population.
The bureau released its list Wednesday, based on an analysis of the first four days of competition.
With a population of 18.8 million people, Australia's total of six gold, five silver and six bronze medals through Tuesday gave it one medal for every 1,111,000 Australians.
Second in the per capita tally was Slovakia, whose four medals came to one for every 1,347,000 people in the central European country of 5.4 million.
The United States, the overall leader in medals with 18, ran only 30th on the per capita board - one for every 15,464,000 Americans.
China, third overall with 15 medals, fared even worse: 40th per capita, with one medal for every 85,171,000 Chinese among its 1.3 billion people.
