Since taking office in May 1997, British Prime Minister Tony Blair has moved swiftly to decentralize power in the United Kingdom.
Scotland, Wales and now Northern Ireland have approved setting up their own legislatures to deal with many bread-and-butter issues, while the government in London remains in charge of defense and foreign affairs:
 
 SCOTLAND
In September referendum, 74 percent voted to create a parliament based in Edinburgh and 63 percent voted in favor of giving it powers to set taxes.
Scotland and England have been governed under the same monarch since 1603, and formally unified in 1707. Scotland has retained a distinct legal system.
 
 WALES
In September referendum, 50 percent voted to create a Welsh assembly, with only half the electorate turning out. The Welsh assembly will have no tax powers and generally fewer powers than the Scottish parliament.
Wales has been formally unified with England since the 16th century.
 
 NORTHERN IRELAND
In results announced Saturday, 71.1 percent voted for a plan that would create an assembly with power shared between Protestants and Catholics.
All of Ireland was unified with Britain in 1801, but most of Ireland won independence in 1922. The new state of Northern Ireland had a Protestant-dominated legislature until 1972, when it was abolished and the British government assumed all government functions.
