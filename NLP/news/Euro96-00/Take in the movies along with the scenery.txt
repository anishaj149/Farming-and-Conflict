You can go to the movies. Or you can travel to the movies.
Film festivals, once the province of Hollywood moguls and movie nuts, have become legitimate tourist destinations. For vacationers who want a dose of culture in their getaways, festivals provide far more enrichment - and entertainment - than the Old Faithful slide show. And when's the last time you bumped into a movie star at Yellowstone National Park?
Four of the world's best film festivals are in North America: the Sundance in Utah, the Telluride in Colorado, the Palm Springs International in California and the Toronto International. They don't rival the glitz of the famous French festival at Cannes, but that's part of the draw. Unlike at Cannes, you can actually watch the movies rather than just watching the movie stars.
Advantages of festivals are threefold. You can see a lot of really good movies in a short period of time, you can discover some of the year's best movies long before they reach your neighborhood, and you can indulge personal interests such as documentaries.
The Palm Springs Festival focuses on foreign films submitted for Oscar consideration. It was among the first showcases for Holland's "Antonia's Line" (1995), Macedonia's "Before the Rain" (1994) and France's "Wild Reeds" (1994). Among the supplemental programs at the 1997 Toronto expo of some 300 films were groups of Balkan works and African films.
Telluride, emerging as one of the most creatively programmed festivals, recently offered world premieres of director Oliver Stone's "U-Turn," John Sayles' "Men With Guns" and Paul Shrader's "Affliction." The Sundance Festival, founded by Robert Redford in the ski resort town of Park City, is the world's top showcase of American independent movies. Among Sundance discoveries are "sex, lies, & videotape," "Shine," "The Brothers McMullen" and Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough feature, "Reservoir Dogs."
At any given festival, it's easy to mix film-going with more typical vacation activities. Since the Sundance Festival is in January, many Park City visitors spend the morning skiing and the late afternoon and evening at the movies. A week before, in Palm Springs, you can play golf on one of the desert's dozens of championship layouts before settling in for the films.
Toronto's festival is just after Labor Day. Even without the movies, Canada's largest and most metropolitan city is a great destination: World-class theater and art museums, great restaurants, an underground city of shops and, best of all, a favorable exchange rate. Currently, the U.S. dollar goes about 30 percent farther in Canada than it does at home.
Telluride's festival, usually just before Labor Day, is set in a small, picturesque Rocky Mountains town that is probably the most restful of the four stops.
There are several critical factors to consider in planning a film festival vacation. First, start planning early, sometimes six months ahead. It's often better to buy a relatively expensive ticket package than more affordable individual admissions. You're assured of seats and avoid disappointment.
Even a package is no guarantee of tickets for the movies or show times you want, although some festivals (especially Palm Springs) have better access than others. Finally, be prepared for an occasional clunker. Every festival has them. But nothing ventured, nothing gained.
