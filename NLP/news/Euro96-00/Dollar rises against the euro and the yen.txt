After a slight recovery just 24 hours earlier, Europe's single currency fell back into its malaise on Wednesday, dropping to its lowest levels against the dollar on concerns the European Central Bank will not prop up the price of the euro anytime soon.
The euro had made a minor comeback in trading late Tuesday when European officials spoke in favor of an intervention.
In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 86.01 cents, down from 86.29 cents late Tuesday.
"We're seeing in the last few hours a reversal of temporary euro gains," said Greg Anderson, financial economist at FleetBoston Financial. "The market doesn't believe that there will be an intervention any time soon."
On Tuesday, the European single currency traded at 85.50 cents, its lowest level since its introduction at $1.16 in January 1999.
Currency traders said that they do not expect the euro to recover easily from its recent free fall against the dollar and the yen.
"For this long-standing 18 months euro fall to reverse, something needs to happen in the global economy," Anderson said. "Either the United States has to become a less interesting place to invest in than Europe, or policy-makers have to have a concerted action to help the (European) currency."
Currency traders are now speculating whether or not an intervention to boost the euro will occur. Many traders believe the euro will fall within the 80 cents range before the end of the year.
In other trading, the dollar continued to its rise against the yen, and was quoted at 107.12 Japanese yen in late New York trading, up from 106.91 yen late Tuesday.
Currency traders said they expected the dollar to trade within the 104-110 yen range in coming months, but added that the breakout would eventually be towards a stronger yen.
In other trading, the British pound recovered slightly from its recent slump against the dollar, and rose to $1.4088 in late New York trading Wednesday, up from $1.4065 late Tuesday. Dragged down by the euro's fall, the British pound hit a 14-year low against the greenback Tuesday when it was quoted at $1.3953, its lowest level since Oct. 20, 1986.
The dollar also was quoted at 1.7695 Swiss francs, up from 1.7677, and 1.4830 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4812.
Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 2.2737 German marks, up from 2.2672; 7.6256 French francs, up from 7.6040; and 2,250.95 Italian lire, up from 2,244.56.
