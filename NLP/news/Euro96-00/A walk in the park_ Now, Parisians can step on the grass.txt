"Keep Off the Grass" signs came off the manicured lawns of Paris' city parks on Thursday. In their place, new signs declared "Welcome."
Traditionally, nature lovers have been confined to sidewalks and paths, risking the ire of blue uniformed, whistle-toting park guards when they ventured onto the grass.
Mayor Jean Tiberi enacted the change after a test period in February to see if the grass could withstand use.
Welcome signs were put up in French, English and Spanish to coax a public that might be shy about lounging on the lawns, which many French see as a custom more suited to the gardens of England.
"Paris English style," announced the daily Le Figaro newspaper.
Dogs and ball players still must keep off the grass, and the change does not affect the city's best-known parks, the Luxembourg and the Tuileries gardens. They are run by the national government, not the city.
