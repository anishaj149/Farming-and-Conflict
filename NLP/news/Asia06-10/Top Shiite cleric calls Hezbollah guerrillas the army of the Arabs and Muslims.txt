Lebanon's top Shiite Muslim cleric hailed Hezbollah militants Thursday as "the soldiers of the Arab and Islamic nation" on their way to triumph over the U.S. and Israel.
Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah saluted the fighters in a video aired on Hezbollah's Al-Manar television.
"You are moving ... to reach a new victory for the nation and to defeat the American and Zionist political pride and all the enemies of freedom in the region and the world," Fadlallah said.
"You are the soldiers of the Arab and Islamic nation and your struggle will bring victory to Arabs, Muslims and the oppressed," he said.
Fadlallah, whose house and office in south Beirut were flattened by Israeli airstrikes last month, urged the guerrillas to continue fighting the "new battle of Khaibar." At Khaibar, the name of an oasis in what is now Saudi Arabia, Islam's prophet Muhammad won a battle against Jews in the year 629.
Fadlallah was believed to be the spiritual leader of Hezbollah in the 1980s, and still has a huge influence with the militant group.
It was not clear where Fadlallah was speaking from or when the video was recorded.
