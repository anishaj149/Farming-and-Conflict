How the U.S. military counts the wounded in Iraq isn't as clear-cut as it might seem. Earlier this year, the Department of Defense changed how it tallies war-related injuries and illnesses, dropping from the overall count those who didn't require airlifts to a military hospital. Some question that approach, saying an accident that occurs in a war zone is a cost of war that should count.
Here is a breakdown of Defense Department numbers from Iraq as of June 2:
52,933: Total for all troops ill or injured in Iraq
34,778: Those needing medical air transport
25,830 troops were wounded in action:
 7,675 airlifted to military hospitals
 18,155 treated and stayed in Iraq
27,103 non-battle-related air transports occurred:
 7,188 had injuries from vehicle accidents, training accidents and sports mishaps.
 19,915 had illnesses or other medical problems. The top 10 causes:
1. General symptoms (fever, pain) that need tests and evaluation
2. Back pain
3. "Adjustment reactions" psychological problems from being in a war zone
4. Disk pain back problems with neurological complications
5. "Effective psychoses" not able to function and care for themselves in a war zone
6. Neurotic disorders
7. Respiratory or chest pain or symptoms
8. Depression
9. Head and neck problems, including traumatic brain injury
10. Epilepsy
The Costs:
$250 billion to $650 billion: Harvard economist's estimate of lifetime health care costs for both Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.
$4 billion a year: cost of disability payments for soldiers who fought in the first Gulf War, which lasted less than two months and produced few casualties.
Sources: Department of Defense, Veterans Administration, Harvard economist Linda Bilmes, interviews with VA and military doctors.
