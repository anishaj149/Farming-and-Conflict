Shanghai's benchmark stock index zipped past the psychological benchmark of 3,000 to a new record Friday, lifted by institutional investors ahead of start of the "year of the golden pig" traditionally thought to bring prosperity.
The Shanghai Composite Index opened at a record high 3,018.18 on Friday, up 0.84 percent from its record close Thursday of 2,993.01.
The benchmark for China's smaller market, the Shenzhen Composite Index, rose 0.8 percent to 756.86.
Chinese markets tend to surge ahead of the lunar new year, which begins this year on Feb. 18, possibly on government-supported buying aimed at giving the markets an auspicious start.
According to the Chinese zodiac calendar, the upcoming year is the "year of the golden pig," a time expected to bring good luck and prosperity.
Heavyweight Baoshan Iron & Steel gained 1.5 percent to 9.44 yuan ($1.22), while CITIC Securities rose 1.8 percent to 42.50 yuan ($5.48).
Mainland China's financial markets will be closed Feb. 17-25 for the holiday.
Meanwhile in currency dealings, the Chinese yuan also climbed to a fresh high against the dollar, boosted by the greenback's weakness against the Japanese yen.
China's central bank set the official, or parity, rate for the dollar at 7.7408 yuan Friday morning, its lowest level against the Chinese currency since Beijing set up the present trading system in July 2005.
The parity rate for the yuan is the weighted average of prices given by market makers, excluding the highest and lowest offers.
