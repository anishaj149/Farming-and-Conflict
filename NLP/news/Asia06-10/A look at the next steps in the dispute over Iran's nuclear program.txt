Iran has ignored a U.N. Security Council deadline to suspend uranium enrichment or face the possibility of sanctions.
The next steps:
 The 35 members of the International Atomic Energy Agency are to study a confidential agency report outlining Iran's compliance with U.N. directives.
 If the report is negative, U.N. Security Council members will begin consultations by mid-September on possible economic or political sanctions.
 U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton said the council will wait to take action until the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, meets with Iran's top negotiator, Ali Larijani, sometime next week.
 U.S. officials are considering relatively mild sanctions such as a travel ban as a first step in hopes of winning the support of Russia and China, both of which have veto power on the Security Council.
 If Russia and China refuse any punishment, the U.S. is considering asking its allies to impose sanctions or financial restrictions of their own, independent of the Security Council.
