A look at economic developments and stock-market activity around the world Thursday:
FRANKFURT, Germany The European Central Bank slashed its main interest rate by a half percentage point to 2 percent but signaled it would slow the pace of future cuts as it sought to protect the 330 million people in the 16 countries that use the euro against a deepening recession. The unanimous decision by the bank's governing council was in line with market expectations and left the rate at its lowest level since December 2005. It followed a three-quarter point cut last month. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told reporters after the bank's announcement there remains clear evidence the euro zone economy is experiencing "a significant slowdown" with little hope for a turnaround this year. The DAX fell 85.62 points, or 1.9 percent, at 4,336.73.
TOKYO Japanese electronics maker Sanyo Electric Co. said it will cut 1,200 jobs globally and barely break even in the fiscal year through March as sales get battered by sinking global demand and a strengthening yen. Nissan Motor Co. said it is slashing domestic production by 64,000 vehicles in February and March to trim inventories and adjust to a drastic slide in global demand. The bad news comes on the heels of media reports that said Japan's No. 3 automaker is likely to post an operating loss in the fiscal year through March, joining a growing list of big Japanese corporate names expected to slide into the red. Meanwhile, Japanese machinery orders, a closely watched indicator of corporate spending, posted the steepest monthly fall on record in November as businesses slashed investment to ride out an ever-deepening recession. Core private sector machinery orders plunged 16.2 percent from the previous month to 754.2 billion yen ($8.38 billion). The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 415.14 points, or 4.9 percent, to 8,023.31. The broader Topix index fell 2.9 percent to 795.99.
LONDON Britain's struggling retailers posted a mixed bag of trading statements, with sales of cheap clothes and baby equipment staying strong while electronics and home improvement goods slumped. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed down 59.53 points, or 1.4 percent, at 4,121.11
BRUSSELS, Belgium European sales of new cars tumbled to a 15-year low last year, carmakers said. The EU car manufacturers' association ACEA said car sales in December were down nearly 18 percent from the same month in 2007. Demand for the entire year fell 7.8 percent across the region the worst decline since 1993. EU regulators called for member states to discuss their plans to help carmakers as it revealed France has been discussing possible subsidies for the industry, which has been hit hard by the economic downturn. Meanwhile, falling yearly inflation in euro nations fell to 1.6 percent in December from 2.1 percent in November.
MOSCOW Russia's ruble fell to its lowest point in more than a decade against the dollar as the Central Bank continued a policy of controlled devaluation. The ruble lost 1.4 percent against a dollar-euro basket in early afternoon trading on the MICEX currency exchange. The ruble dropped 0.6 rubles against the dollar, to 32.2 its lowest since December 1997, just before the government redenominated the national currency. The decreases marked the 16th devaluation of the ruble since Nov. 11, when the government launched a controlled slide that has seriously depleted its currency reserves.
KIEV, Ukraine Ukraine rejected Russia's latest request to pipe natural gas westward to increasingly frustrated EU consumers, deepening the bitter economic and political dispute that has paralyzed energy shipments to Europe. Desperate to restore supplies, the European Union said it was ready to join a weekend meeting between Russia and Ukraine to seek a solution to the crisis that has left eastern Europe frantically scrambling for heat, light and power. With the cutoff of Russian gas supplies via Ukraine in its ninth day, there was little sign of an end to the delivery drought despite the EU's vocal objections.
TOULOUSE, France Airbus expects orders to dip below deliveries in 2009 for the first time in six years as airlines curb spending amid the economic crisis, the planemaker's head said. Meanwhile, French President Nicolas Sarkozy asked French banks to suspend bonuses for top executives for 2008 following the 360 billion euros ($476 billion) bailout package for French financial institutions announced last October. Sarkozy also urged companies to adopt the recommendation of French employer's union Medef to ban generous severance packages for executives. The CAC-40 declined 56.12 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,994.88.
SEOUL, South Korea Moody's Investors Service said it may downgrade the ratings of some of South Korea's top banks over concerns they are too dependent on the government for foreign currency funding amid the global financial crisis. Among the 10 banks put on review for possible downgrade were lenders Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank and Hana Bank as well as Citibank Korea. The Kospi dropped 6 percent to 1,111.34.
SHANGHAI, China Foreign direct investment in China rose 23.6 percent in 2008 to $92.4 billion but growth declined in the final months of the year, a state news agency reported. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed down 0.5 percent, or 8.66 points, at 1920.21, while the Shenzhen Composite Index for China's smaller second exchange rose 0.3 percent to 595.87. The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 200.7 points, or 4.4 percent, to close at 4,320.77. Hong Kong's main stock index fell 3.4 percent amid a regional sell-off, with heavyweight lender HSBC tumbling to its lowest level in nearly a decade. The blue chip Hang Seng Index ended down 461.65 points at 13,242.96.
GENEVA The world economy is heading for zero growth in 2009 as a deepening recession in rich countries slows the sale of consumer goods and raw materials from developing nations, the United Nations said. The global body's trade and development office, UNCTAD, said it has downgraded its forecast for this year after a worse-than-expected economic performance during the fourth quarter of 2008.
SYDNEY, Australia Unemployment in Australia inched up to a two-year high of 4.5 percent in December, but fewer jobs were lost than economists had expected amid the global slump. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the unemployment rate rose from 4.4 percent in November. The economy lost 1,200 jobs in December. The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index closed down 157.5 points, or 4.3 percent, at 3,529.5 and the broader All Ordinaries index fell 147.5 points, or 4.1 percent, to 3,476.8.
WELLINGTON, New Zealand New Zealand's battered economy faces a year of stagnation with no recovery in sight until 2010, the government said, as it warned tens of thousands of workers will lose their jobs. Prime Minister John Key pledged an economic stimulus package worth 9 billion New Zealand dollars ($4.8 billion) over the next two years to minimize damage from the international economic crisis. The index of top 50 New Zealand companies fell 1.6 percent to 2,742.84.
COPENHAGEN, Denmark Denmark's central bank lowered its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3 percent. The move came in response to an earlier decision by the European Central Bank to lower its rate by a half percentage point to 2 percent.
MANILA, Philippines The World Bank said it found evidence of bid-rigging in a Philippine road project involving several Chinese and local construction companies and has barred them from future contracts.
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia Mongolia asked China for a $3 billion loan to help shore up troubled banks and develop trade as global economic turmoil drives down prices for its exports of coal, copper and cashmere, the government said. The request includes $1 billion to stabilize Mongolian banks and $2 billion to finance road building, industrial and agriculture projects to expand trade with China.
