Significant dates in the history of the Navy's detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba:
 Jan. 11, 2002: The first 20 detainees, suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban, are flown in hoods and shackles to the new detention center on the eastern tip of Cuba.
 Feb. 27, 2002: Nearly 200 detainees, of the approximately 300 held at that time, participate in a hunger strike, the first publicly known mass protest over conditions at the camp.
 July 30, 2004: The military holds the first Combatant Status Review Tribunal to decide whether a detainee is an "enemy combatant," who should be held. Of the 558 detainees who received a hearing, the panels classified all but 38 as enemy combatants.
 Dec. 14, 2004: The military starts annual Administrative Review Board hearings to determine whether a detainee no longer poses a danger or has intelligence value. In the first round, the military reviews 463 cases and determines that 329 should still be held.
 June 10, 2006: Three detainees, two from Saudi Arabia and one from Yemen, die in apparent suicides by hanging themselves with bed sheets.
 May 18, 2006: About 10 detainees in a communal living section of Guantanamo reserved for the most compliant prisoners use broken fan blades and other makeshift weapons to battle guards in what authorities say was the one of the most violent incidents at the prison.
 June 29, 2006: The Supreme Court, in a rebuke of President Bush and his terror policies, rules that planned military trials at Guantanamo Bay violate U.S. and international law.
 Sept. 6, 2006: President Bush announces that 14 key terrorist leaders have been transferred from secret CIA custody to Guantanamo Bay, to be prepared for eventual trials. The high-value suspected terrorists include Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.
 Oct. 17, 2006: Bush signed a new law that allows for the trial of enemy combatants by military commissions and strips them of the right to seek their freedom in U.S. courts.
