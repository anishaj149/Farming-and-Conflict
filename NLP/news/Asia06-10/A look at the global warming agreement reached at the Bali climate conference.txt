Key points of the final decision at the U.N. climate change conference setting an agenda for talks on a new global warming pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol at the end of 2012:
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS:
It recognizes that "deep cuts" in global emissions will be required to prevent dangerous human interference in the climate. It references scientific reports that suggest a range of cuts between 25 and 40 percent by 2020, but prescribes no such targets itself.
DEADLINE:
Negotiations for the next climate accord should last for two years and conclude in 2009 in order to allow enough time to implement it at the end of 2012. Four major climate meetings will take place next year.
RICH AND POOR:
Negotiators should consider binding reductions of gas emissions by industrialized countries, while developing countries should consider moves to control the growth of their emissions. Richer countries should work to transfer climate-friendly technology to poorer nations.
ADJUSTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE:
Negotiators should look at supporting urgent steps to help poorer countries adapt to inevitable effects of global warming, such as building seawalls to guard against rising oceans.
DEFORESTATION:
Negotiators should consider "positive incentives" for reducing deforestation in developing countries, many of which are seeking international compensation for preserving their forest "sinks" absorbing carbon dioxide.
