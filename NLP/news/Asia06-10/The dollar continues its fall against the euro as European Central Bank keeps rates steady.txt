The dollar continued its decline against the euro Thursday after the European Central Bank kept its interest rate steady and U.S. jobless claims hit a two-month high.
The 13-nation euro bought $1.3488 in afternoon European trading, up from $1.3427 in New York late Wednesday. That put the euro less than two cents short of its all-time high of $1.3667, reached in December 2004.
The euro was up amid the ECB's decision to keep its interest rate unchanged at 3.75 percent and Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet's tacit admission that it would likely lift the rate to 4 percent by June.
That met analysts' expectations, many of whom predicted that another quarter point would come before the start of the summer, said David Jones, chief market analyst with CMC Markets in London.
Higher interest rates, used to combat inflation, can bolster a currency by making certain types of investments more attractive.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has left rates unchanged over recent months even as the ECB steadily increased the cost of borrowing.
The dollar was also hurt by worse-than-expected jobless claims in the U.S. which saw the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits reach a two-month high.
That helped push the British pound up slightly to $1.9791 from $1.9753 and caused the dollar to fall to 119.01 Japanese yen from 119.30 yen.
The U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday that applications for jobless benefits totaled 342,000 last week, up 19,000 from the previous week.
The increase, which followed a rise of 13,000 the previous week, was much larger than had been expected and pushed total claims to the highest level since the week of Feb. 10.
In a second report, the price of imported goods rose by 1.7 percent in March, the biggest jump in 10 months. The Labor Department said the spike in import prices was driven by a 9 percent rise in the cost of imported petroleum, the largest increase in this category in 11 months. The price of non-petroleum imports rose a more modest 0.3 percent.
