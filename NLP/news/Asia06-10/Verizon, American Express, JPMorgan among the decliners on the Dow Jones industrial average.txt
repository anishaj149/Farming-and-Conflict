Verizon Communications helped pull down the Dow Jones industrial average Tuesday, posting the largest loss for the session on the blue chip index.
The DJIA ended down 148.27, or 1.1 percent, at 13,501.70. Only five stocks among the 30 on the index posted gains for the day, while 25 ended in the red.
Shares of Verizon were off $1.50, or 3.6 percent, to close at $40.52, following news of draft rules from the Federal Communications Commission that would allow new companies to bid in a major auction of radio spectrum, which could create new competition for telecom companies that offer national broadband service.
American Express shares fell $2.14, or 3.4 percent, to $60.30.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. were off $1.28, or 2.6 percent, to $47.51 after Standard & Poor's said it is considering cutting the credit rating of more than $12 billion in bonds backed by risky home loans, including some bonds issued by major banks including JPMorgan Chase.
On the positive side, Caterpillar Inc. shares added $1.39, to end at $81.22, posting its third day of gains.
General Motors Corp. gained following an upgrade from JPMorgan Securities to "Overweight," or "Buy." Shares of the Detroit automaker added 64 cents, to $37.41.
And shares of Boeing Co. continued an eight-day winning streak, adding 35 cents to end at $100.25. Late Monday, the company said it sold 45 jets to China Southern Airlines. The stock also benefited from news the Air Force declined competitor Lockheed Martin's attempt to submit an updated bid for a helicopter program in an appeal of a deal awarded to Boeing.
