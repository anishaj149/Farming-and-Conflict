The U.S. military said on Friday that firebrand Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr had returned to Iran, where he had spent several months earlier this year as the United States was sending 30,000 additional troops to the Baghdad area. Al-Sadr's office said he was still in Iraq.
Col. John Castles, commander of the 82 Airborne Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, disclosed the information in a teleconference with Pentagon reporters and said it was based on U.S. intelligence reports. He did not elaborate.
A spokesman in al-Sadr's headquarters in the holy city of Najaf, south of Baghdad, called the U.S. assertion a "baseless rumor."
"The Americans are just trying to find out where al-Sadr is," the spokesman said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about al-Sadr's closely guarded movements.
Al-Sadr came under heavy pressure to order his fighters not to confront the Americans as increase in U.S. troops began in February. He is believed to have complied, then left the country for Iran.
He appeared again in public in Iraq on May 25, but was last heard from inside the country on June 28.
