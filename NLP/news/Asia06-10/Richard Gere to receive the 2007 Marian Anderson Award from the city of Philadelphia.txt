Richard Gere will receive the 2007 Marian Anderson Award for his advocacy efforts on behalf of independence for Tibet and better care for HIV/AIDS patients.
"His accomplishments as an actor are only surpassed by his accomplishments as a humanitarian and as an advocate for human rights issues around the world," Mayor John F. Street said Tuesday in announcing the award.
Gere, 57, has served as the chairman of the board of the International Campaign for Tibet and has sponsored the Dalai Lama on two trips to the United States. He also started a foundation bearing his name and a public charity, Healing the Divide, that work to better medical care for HIV/AIDS patients.
The Marian Anderson Award is given by the city each year to an artist or performer for humanitarian efforts.
The award is named in honor of the first black singer to perform with the New York Metropolitan Opera. She served as a special envoy to the Far East and was named a delegate to the United Nations by President Eisenhower.
Gere, a native of Philadelphia, will receive the award at a Nov. 12 gala featuring a concert by the Philadelphia Orchestra.
His screen credits include "Chicago," "Pretty Woman" and "An Officer and a Gentleman."
