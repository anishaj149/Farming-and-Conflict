Shanghai's benchmark stock index surged past the psychological benchmark of 3,000 to a new record Friday, though share prices later fell back to close only marginally higher amid renewed profit-taking.
The Shanghai Composite Index index gained 0.2 percent to close at 2,998.47 on Friday. It opened at a record high 3,018.18, up 0.84 percent from Thursday's close.
The benchmark for China's smaller market, the Shenzhen Composite Index, rose 1.0 percent to 758.02.
Institutional investors bought retailers and automakers ahead of Sunday's start of the Year of the Pig traditionally thought to bring good luck and prosperity. According to the Chinese zodiac calendar, the upcoming year is a doubly promising Year of the Golden Pig, which comes only once in decades.
FAW Car hit the 10 percent upper limit at 7.17 yuan on Friday and Shanghai Automotive surged 10 percent to 12.83 yuan. Expectations for strong sales during the new year holiday boosted Beijing Department Store by 10 percent to 9.79 yuan. Shanghai Yuyuan Tourist Mart also rose 10 percent, to 18.52 yuan.
But the gains were offset by investors selling to lock in profits. China Petroleum & Chemical fell 1.6 percent to 9.49 yuan and CITIC Securities slipped 2.1 percent to 40.89 yuan.
Chinese markets tend to surge ahead of the lunar new year which begins this year on Feb. 18 possibly on government-supported buying aimed at giving the markets an auspicious start.
Mainland China's financial markets will be closed Feb. 17-25 for the holidays.
Chinese share prices doubled last year as investors piled into the market following the completion of shareholding reforms that helped to reduce worries over a potential flood of shares entering the market.
But the markets have become increasingly volatile. The Shanghai Composite index fell nearly 5 percent on Jan. 31 amid worries over high stock valuations, but has since rallied back. Friday's close puts it 12 percent above its end-2006 level.
China still limits foreigners' purchases of the yuan-denominated stocks that make up the biggest share of the markets, though that is gradually changing as regulators allow increasing participation by so-called qualified foreign institutional investors.
In currency dealings Friday, the Chinese yuan also climbed to a fresh high against the dollar, boosted by the greenback's weakness against the Japanese yen.
The dollar was at 7.7478 yuan on the over-the-counter market at 0730 GMT, down from Thursday's close of 7.7555.
China's central bank set the official, or parity, rate for the dollar at 7.7408 Friday morning, its lowest level against the Chinese currency since Beijing set up the present trading system in July 2005.
The parity rate for the yuan is the weighted average of prices given by market makers, excluding the highest and lowest offers.
