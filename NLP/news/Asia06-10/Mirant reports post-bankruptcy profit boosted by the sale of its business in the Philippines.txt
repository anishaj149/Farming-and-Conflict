Mirant Corp., an international energy company, said Monday it posted an increased fourth-quarter profit, boosted by a number of one-time gains.
Quarterly earnings rose to $1.32 billion, or $4.89 per share, from $207 million during the same period in 2005, when it was operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and did not record earnings per share.
Results included a tax benefit of $845 million related to the pending sale of its Philippine business, a $221 million gain from the settlement of a New York property tax dispute and $72 million in other nonrecurring items. Excluding those items, the company said it earned $186 million, or 69 cents per share, in the most recent quarter.
Revenue fell to $550 million from $1.11 billion during the same quarter a year earlier.
The company said an increase in the realized value of its hedges, which was partly offset by lower power prices and lower generation volumes, drove revenue in the period.
Annual earnings improved to a profit of $1.86 billion, or $6.28 per share, from a loss of $1.31 billion, or $4.36 per share in 2005. Adjusted for special items, the company said it earned $644 million, or $2.17 per share, in 2006.
Revenue fell to $3.1 billion from $4.18 billion in 2005.
