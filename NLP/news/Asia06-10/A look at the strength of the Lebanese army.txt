Lebanon's military is a volunteer force of about 60,000 members, and for decades has acted largely as an internal security force to keep the peace in a nation buffeted by conflict and instability. Here's a look at its strength:
 Infantry: The army has 11 combat brigades, 1 Presidential Guard brigade, and five special regiments. Troops are mainly armed with U.S.-made M-16 and Russian-made AK-47 assault rifles.
 Armor: 160 T-55 Russian-made tanks, 60 M-48 U.S.-made battle tanks, about 1,000 M-113 tracked U.S.-made armored personnel carriers and a number of wheeled armored carriers. The U.S. pledges to deliver M-60 tanks in spring 2009.
 Artillery: 80 U.S.-and French-made 155mm, 30 Russian-made 130mm, 200 Russian-made 122mm, 40 Russian-made multiple rocket launchers.
 Air Force: Four 1950s-era, British-made Hawker Hunters fighter jets, 24 UH-1H US-made helicopters and nine french-made Gazelle helicopters that are unarmed. Russia pledged in December to give Lebanon 10 MiG-29 fighter jets.
 Navy: About 30 patrol boats and landing crafts.
