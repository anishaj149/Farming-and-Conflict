Stocks fell in China Tuesday but surged in Japan on a quiet day for world markets as most exchanges around the world were closed for the Christmas holiday.
China stocks fell Tuesday, as renewed worries over the possibility of a tighter monetary policy hit property developers and market heavyweight PetroChina fell on profit taking.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.6 percent, or 33.08 points, on 5,201.18. But the smaller Shenzhen Composite Index rose 0.7 percent to 1,409.81.
PetroChina, which holds a 20 percent weighting in the Shanghai Composite Index, fell 2.2 percent to 31.25 yuan. The stock gained in recent days but is now 29 percent below the peak it hit on its Nov. 5 debut.
Japanese markets, which were closed for a national holiday Monday, jumped Tuesday in thin post-holiday trade.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index rose 295.59 points, or 1.94 percent, to close at 15,552.59 points on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Tuesday. The index added 1.5 percent, to close at 15,257.00 points Friday.
Stocks also gained in Taiwan and Vietnam, rising too in Thailand despite political uncertainty after deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said Tuesday he was planning to return home from exile and might advise the victorious party in last weekend's elections.
