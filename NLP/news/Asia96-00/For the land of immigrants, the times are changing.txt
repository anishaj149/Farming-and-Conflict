America is a nation built by immigrants, but a new look at where they come from and where they go shows the times are changing.
Europe, traditionally prime source of Americans born elsewhere, has lost that leading position in an era of changing immigration patterns.
And the big industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest, the destination of millions of new arrivals in the last century, have received very little immigration in the last generation, sharply reducing their percentage of foreign-born residents, according to a Census Bureau report being released Tuesday.
Beginning in the 1960s and growing in the '70s and '80s, Latin America and Asia sharply increased their share of immigrants, and an increasing share began settling in the South and West, explained Census population expert Campbell Gibson.
A century ago nearly 90 percent of foreign-born Americans came from Europe. But that dropped to just 22.9 percent by 1990, according to the compilation of historical data.
By comparison, 44.3 percent of foreign-born U.S. residents were from Latin America and 26.3 percent were from Asia, the Census Bureau reported.
Updated historical records show that Europeans were the main source of foreign-born residents from the earliest record in 1850 through 1980.
But by 1990, Mexico alone was home to nearly as many U.S. residents as all of Europe, 4,298,014 compared to 4,350,403.
Overall, there were 19.8 million foreign-born Americans counted in the 1990 census, or 7.9 percent of the nation's total population. A century earlier, the 1890 national head count found 9.2 million foreign born, or 14.8 percent of the total.
The nation's foreign-born population slipped to a low of 4.7 percent in 1970, and then began rising again, climbing to 6.2 percent in 1980.
The long-term declining percentage of U.S. residents born elsewhere varies considerably from place to place, but for the most part the nation's cities had much larger shares of people born elsewhere 100 years ago.
For example, 35.3 percent of people living in Boston were foreign-born in 1890, but that fell to 20.0 percent by 1990.
In the same period, the share of foreign-born fell from 39.7 percent to just 3.4 percent in Detroit; in Denver it dropped from 23.9 percent to 7.4 percent; it fell from 36.8 percent to 6.1 percent in Minneapolis, and in Pittsburgh it has dipped from 30.7 percent to 4.6 percent
But some cities in the South and West increased their share of foreign-born residents.
Miami counted 59.7 percent of its residents as foreign-born in 1990. Detailed Census records for the city don't go back to 1890, but 25.0 percent of Miami residents were foreign-born in 1920, and that was down to just 9.7 percent in 1940.
The portion of foreign-born residents in Houston climbed from 11.3 percent in 1890 to 17.8 percent 100 years later.
And Los Angeles' 38.4 percent foreign-born in 1990 was up from 25.3 percent a century earlier.
But over the same period the foreign-born share in San Diego slipped from 25.4 percent to 20.9 percent and in San Francisco it fell from 42.4 percent to 34.0 percent.
Of the foreign-born U.S. residents in 1990, 44.3 percent came from Latin America, including Mexico; 26.3 percent from Asia; 22.9 percent from Europe; 4.0 from North America; 1.9 percent from Africa; 0.5 percent from the Pacific Islands.
In 1890, the shares were Europe, 86.9 percent, North America, 10.6 percent; Asia, 1.2 percent; Latin America, 1.2 percent; Pacific Islands, 0.1 percent.
