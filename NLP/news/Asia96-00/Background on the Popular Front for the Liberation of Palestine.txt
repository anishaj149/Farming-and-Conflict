The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, based in Damascus, Syria, has claimed responsibility for the attack that killed an Israeli woman and her 12-year-old son near a West Bank settlement.
It is a group that:
-rejected Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's peace accord with Israel, supports armed struggle to achieve secular state in all of the land of Palestine, including what is now Israel.
-maintains West Bank military arm, the Red Eagles, which has carried out drive-by shootings and other attacks in Israel and the West Bank that claimed the lives of five people in June and July.
-carried out spectacular attacks in the 1960s and '70s including hijacking of three airliners that were brought to Jordan in September 1970 and blown up after the passengers were released. The incident triggered a civil war in which Palestinians were expelled from Jordan.
Wednesday's attack occurred on the anniversary of the group's 1977 founding by Dr. George Habash, a physician by training who was a refugee from the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948 and founder of a pan-Arab nationalist movement. Habash's health has been poor in recent years and he has reportedly sought treatment in Jordan.
The PFLP spawned several other Marxist-oriented splinter factions. These included Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine headed by Nayef Hawatmeh and General Command faction headed by Ahmed Jibril, both based in Damascus.
The PFLP was the second-largest Palestinian faction after Arafat's Fatah faction until rise of Islamic opposition groups such as Hamas.
