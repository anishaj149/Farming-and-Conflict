The Tokyo stock market opened the year's first trading day higher Monday as investors returned from the holidays. The dollar was higher against the yen.
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 38,86 points, or 0.25 percent, to 15,297.60 in the first 30 minutes of Monday's half-day trading.
On Dec. 30, the index rose 483.52 points, or 3.27 percent, closing the last trading of 1997 at 15,258.74.
Japanese financial markets were closed from Dec. 31 to Jan. 4 for the new year holidays. The market will resume regular full-day sessions on Tuesday.
Before the trading began, stock exchange officials and investors gathered on the trading floor and marked the first trading day of the year with a traditional rhythmic hand clapping.
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section gained 5.72 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,180.75. The TOPIX had gained 27.16 points, or 2.37 percent, on Dec. 30.
Traders said investors want to see the Nikkei rise as a good omen on the first business day of the year but the gain would be limited because of concerns over Japan's troubled economy.
In currency trading, the dollar was sharply higher compared to its Tokyo level last Tuesday. But it slipped from late Friday in New York.
At 9 a.m., the dollar was 132.08 yen, up 2.16 yen from its late Tokyo level of 129.92 yen last Tuesday but below its late New York level Friday of 132.55 yen.
Traders said that Japanese exporters and speculators were selling the dollar to take profits from the currency's 5 1/2 year high on Friday.
The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.650 percent from 1.640 percent Tuesday, driving its price down to 109.22 yen from 109.35 yen.
