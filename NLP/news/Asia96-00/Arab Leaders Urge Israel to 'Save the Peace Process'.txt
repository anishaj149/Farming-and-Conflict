Arab leaders will appeal to Israel in their weekend summit to "save the peace process" by dropping policies that deviate from the land-for-peace formula accepted by both sides for negotiations.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa outlined the view after meeting Friday with fellow Arab foreign ministers to draft the communique to be issued by the 21 Arab leaders meeting here Saturday and Sunday.
Moussa said that the announced policies of new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threaten the peace process. The Arab summit would send a "clear-cut and prudent" message to Israel and the international community as the sponsor of Arab-Israeli talks, he added.
"There will be no messages of threats or warning," he said. "But what I am saying is that it takes two parties to establish and save the peace process."
The first Arab summit in six years was called by Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia after the May 29 election of the hard-line Netanyahu.
At least 13 heads of state will attend the summit, along with princes and prime ministers. As well as adopting a stand on Israel, they will have to deal with other issues, chiefly divisions over Iraq.
Iraq was not invited to the meeting because of continued anger among oil-rich Persian Gulf states over the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said "psychological obstacles" also divide the leaders. He said he hoped to arrange a meeting between Jordan, which has made full peace with Israel, and Syria, which is the most recalcitrant negotiator with the Jewish state.
Mubarak made a gesture at solving his own country's dispute with neighboring Sudan,, which Egypt accuses of stirring up Egyptian Muslim militants.
The Egyptian leader went to Cairo's airport to greet Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir. Mubarak, wearing a business suit, and el-Bashir, in Arab robes and a billowing turban, looked like they were from two different worlds as they walked together.
Speaking on Egyptian television later, Mubarak said that reports that the summit would castigate Israel were not correct. "It is not against Israel," he said.
However, Arab leaders have grown increasingly worried as Netanyahu's government has issued policy guidelines different from those of his predecessor, Shimon Peres, that oppose the return of the Golan Heights to Syria and the establishment of a Palestinian state.
The guidelines call for no discussion about the future of Arab east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their future capital.
Referring to Netanyahu, Moussa said: "We would like him to reconsider his guidelines and documents, which are upsetting and threatening the peace process and all of us."
"We are concerned but we would like to give the other party the chance to go back to the talks," he added.
A draft copy of the communique, obtained by The Associated Press, reaffirms the Arab commitment to peace and urges Israel to do the same without delay.
It also calls for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and east Jerusalem, which were seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, as well as southern Lebanon.
Moussa said the talks should resume on the basis that Israel would leave occupied Arab land in exchange for peace, the principle embodied in U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 and accepted by the Madrid conference that began the peace process almost five years ago.
Moussa's moderate tone follows pleas by the United States that the Arabs not reject Netanyahu as a peace partner. His reference to the international community was a clear message to Washington and Europe to pressure Israel not to back down from agreements already reached in peace talks.
For his part, Netanyahu has sought to reassure the Arabs by urging the resumption of talks without "pre-conditions," but Arab officials and newspapers have pointed out that his policy guidelines set conditions about the Golan and Jerusalem.
On Friday, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy met with Egypt's ambassador to Israel, Mohammed Bassyouni, and called on the Arabs not to take extreme positions on Israel's policies.
"We want open dialogue on every front. We want peace with Syria (and) … with the Palestinians," Levy said.
But Bassyouni responded that Israel's positions were so extreme that they left no room for negotiation.
