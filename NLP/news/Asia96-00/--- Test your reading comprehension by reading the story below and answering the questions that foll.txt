Weight Limit On Thai Book Bags
 Thai students need to lighten up. Literally. The education ministry is imposing weight limits on their book bags.
The ministry is concerned that primary school students, almost half of whom were found to be carrying bags weighing more than 6 pounds, were risking spinal damage.
"Students complain they are unhappy about two things: too much homework and too heavy bags," ministry official Boonchan Buahoong said.
Under a ministry order issued Monday, kindergarten students would not be allowed to carry more than 2.2 pounds - the equivalent of two hardcover children's books. Elementary students are limited to 4.4 pounds, about the weight of a college dictionary, a fat paperback and a magazine.
High school students are allowed to lug up to 6.6 pounds - the equivalent of the Manhattan yellow pages, a world almanac and a magazine.
