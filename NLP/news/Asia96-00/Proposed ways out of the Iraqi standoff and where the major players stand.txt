Russia and France are pushing proposals to end the standoff between the United States and Iraq over U.N. inspections of suspected weapons sites. The proposals, and where the major players stand:
 
 RUSSIA:
The Russian initiative calls for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to appoint a new team to inspect eight presidential sites that Iraq has declared off limits.
These sites would be open for inspection for a limited period.
The U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which oversees the arms inspections and has been working in Iraq since 1991, would be excluded from those eight sites.
 
 FRANCE:
The French suggest that UNSCOM inspectors work alongside "a special group" that remains to be determined. The special group would inspect residences within the presidential compounds; UNSCOM could inspect the rest. The weapons experts would have free access without any time limit on their inspections.
 
 THE UNITED STATES:
Citing Security Council resolutions, the United States insists that UNSCOM inspectors alone inspect suspected weapons sites. It also insists on access to all sites on demand and for as long as needed.
 
 IRAQ:
Iraq claims that the American UNSCOM inspectors are spies, and doesn't want to grant unfettered access to presidential compounds, ministries and military installations it regards symbols of its sovereignty. Iraq says it has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction, as well as its capacity to build such weapons.
