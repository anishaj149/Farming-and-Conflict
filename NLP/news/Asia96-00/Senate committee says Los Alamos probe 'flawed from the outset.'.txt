The FBI's espionage case against a Los Alamos weapons scientist was considered "flawed from the outset" because authorities identified a number of other suspects, but failed to investigate them, a congressional report revealed today.
The report also disclosed for the first time that in a polygraph test in February when the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was asked if he had passed nuclear secrets "to any unauthorized person," he failed the test.
The report by the leaders of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee described a string of missteps, communications lapses and misunderstandings over three years that prevented the FBI from establishing a strong case against the Taiwan-born scientist.
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., the committee chairman, said the investigation was "beset by communications failures and poor judgment" and that Attorney General Janet Reno for the most part "was out of the loop" despite the issue's importance.
"The government's investigation was not a comedy of errors, but a tragedy of errors," said Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the committee's ranking Democrat. He too said Reno should have been more closely involved.
Asked this morning if she had seen the report, Reno said she had not had time to examine the details.
The findings summarized information gathered during two closed-door hearings the committee held on the federal investigation into Lee. He was fired from his top-secret job last March after being the primary suspect since 1996 in the alleged theft by China of secrets involving the sophisticated W-88 nuclear warhead in the 1980s.
Lee has not been charged with a crime, although a federal grand jury was hearing evidence in the ongoing case. In his only public comments, Lee in a television interview last Sunday categorically denied providing nuclear secrets to China or anyone else.
But the Senate report disclosed that last February, Lee was asked during an FBI polygraph test whether he had ever given specific classified computer code related to weapons testing, or "passed W-88 information to any unauthorized person?"
"Wen Ho Lee failed this polygraph test," said the report.
The 30-page report provided new details on the FBI's failed attempts to get Justice Department approval to search Lee's office computer.
Referring to the dispute between the FBI and Justice over the computer search, the bipartisan report said it was "remarkable" that FBI Director Louis Freeh "at no point contacted the attorney general about this issue"
Reno was made aware of the FBI's problems in getting approval for a computer search during a meeting in August 1997, the report said. She asked the deputy attorney general's office to look into it, but never heard back from that office, the report said.
The FBI's attempt to get clearance for a computer search, however, was made more difficult in part because of FBI bungling, the report suggested.
As early as 1996, a series of misunderstandings between an FBI field agent and Los Alamos officials failed to make clear that apparently Lee had agreed on his computer being searched and that his computer, in fact, carried a "banner" warning such searches could be made.
The failure to provide accurate information to senior FBI and Justice officials had "significant implications for the course of the Lee espionage investigation," the report said.
Last March, investigators finally searched Lee's computer and found he had transferred thousands of top-secret computer code files from the Los Alamos highly secured computer system to his unclassified office computer that was linked to the Internet. It has not been determined whether any of the data ever left the lab.
Lee, who appeared to pass another lie detecter test, was fired on March 8.
At one point, the Justice Department's office that reviewed requests for the Lee computer search described the case as "flawed from the outset" because the FBI had focused almost exclusively on Lee and his wife, also a Los Alamos employee, while other suspects were ignored.
"The DOE and Bureau had (multiple) suspects, and only two were investigated," Justice attorney Allan Kornblum told the Senate committee, according to the report.
These other suspects also had access to the secret information at Los Alamos, traveled to China, had contacts with Chinese scientists visiting the New Mexico lab, and fit the profile that made Lee a prime suspect, the report said. Still, they were not investigated in any detail, although the FBI questioned some of them earlier this year, the report said.
