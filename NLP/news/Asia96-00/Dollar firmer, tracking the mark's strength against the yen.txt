The dollar gained against the yen but eased against the mark and other currencies Wednesday. Traders, perceiving little improvement in political uncertainty in Japan, bought the German currency as a safe haven from the faltering yen.
Late in the trading session in New York Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 142.35 yen, up from 141.35 late Tuesday, and 1.7706 marks, down from 1.7937 Tuesday.
The dollar dropped early against the yen on the news in Tokyo that Keizo Obuchi, the likely successor to resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, had chosen former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to head the high-profile Finance Ministry.
Miyazawa, who was prime minister from 1991-1993, was the well respected architect of the government's plan to bail out its banking system. But he was seen by some as part of a conservative old guard that may not provide the innovation needed to solve Japan's economic problems.
And traders who backed off the yen in New York on Wednesday did so by buying marks, not dollars, pushing the German currency higher against the U.S. currency.
They are not confident enough about U.S. economic figures due out later this week to make big bets on the dollar, said Robert Katz, a dealer with MTB Bank Corp. in New York.
"I think there's still a little bit of nervousness," he said, ahead of the government's release Friday of a report on growth in the gross domestic product during the April-June quarter. The report, he said, "is expected to show a little weakness" in the economy.
Against other currencies, the dollar traded at 1.4970 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5020 Tuesday; 5.9280 French francs, down from 5.9335; and 1.4835 Swiss francs, down from 1.4887. The British pound was trading at $ 1.6461, down from $ 1.6694 late Tuesday.
