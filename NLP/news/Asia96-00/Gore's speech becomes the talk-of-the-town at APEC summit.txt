Reaction to U.S. Vice President Al Gore's comments about Malaysia's protest movement:
 
 ----
-"Of course I am happy, and I think it is appropriate for Mr. Gore to have come out with this," said Azizah Ismail, wife of jailed Malaysian dissident Anwar Ibrahim. "What he spoke about is in the spirit of APEC: democracy, transparency, accountability and good governance."
----
"The vice president is entitled to his own opinion. I believe that as the president of a democratic country, I go along with his opinion," said Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
 
 ----
"(Gore's) preaching about democratic principles rings hollow and must be seen for what it really is," said Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. "The system of government here has evolved out of Malaysia's historical experiences and expressed through constitutional and democratic means."
 
 ----
Lim Kit Siang, opposition leader in Parliament, said the government could have avoided the humiliation if it were more responsive to demands for democracy: "There is a feeling of national embarrassment that a foreign leader should be talking about the need for democratic change in Malaysia on our own soil."
 
 ----
Australian Prime Minister John Howard: "You don't necessarily achieve desirable outcomes by constantly hectoring other nations in order to change the way they run their lives."
