Beijing has shown the door to Tom and Jerry, the Jetsons, Scooby Doo, Popeye and the rest of their American cartoon cronies, taking TNT's Cartoon Network off China's airwaves.
Chinese authorities have removed the television network from a list of approved stations for use in upscale tourist hotels and housing compounds for foreigners.
The government isn't saying why. Spokesmen of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television spokesmen refused to comment when asked Thursday about the change.
Hema Govindan, a spokeswoman for Turner Broadcast System Asia Pacific Inc. in Hong Kong, said Cartoon Network was removed from the list for all of this year. CNN, also owned by Turner, is still on the approved list.
Govindan said Turner was negotiating with hotels, who were getting less than they paid for without Cartoon Network.
"We don't have a lot of information at this point, but we're trying to get information and work with our hotel clients," Govindan said.
But Cartoon Network was still showing Thursday in at least one compound in Beijing where foreign diplomats and reporters live. Government rules designed to restrict the influence of satellite television have long been ignored in many parts of the country.
Chinese television has been developing its own brand of cartoons in recent years that emphasize Chinese culture and patriotism. Many use animals or folk tale characters as their heroes.
Govindan said the company uses one channel in southeast Asia for TNT, which shows classic movies by night and cartoons by day. The restricted audience in China, estimated in the tens of thousands, is small compared with an audience of millions in the region.
