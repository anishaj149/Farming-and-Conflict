The toll of the 16-day war between Israel and the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah:
---
 
 CASUALTIES:
At least 159 people killed, all on Lebanese soil, most Lebanese civilians. In the worst single attack, at least 91 Lebanese refugees died in Israel's shelling of a U.N. base in the village of Qana.
Overall, Hezbollah said it lost 13 fighters, while Israel estimated the Hezbollah dead at 50. At least 339 people were injured on both sides of the border. No Israeli civilians were reported killed.

 REFUGEES:
An estimated 500,000 Lebanese civilians were driven from their homes in the south and some 20,000 Israelis were displaced from northern towns.
---
 
 DAMAGE:
Israeli airstrikes damaged two power relay stations in Beirut, reducing electricity in the capital to six hours a day. Other parts of the country receive even less power. Water reservoirs were destroyed and roads bombed out in dozens of southern Lebanon villages.
Hezbollah fired more than 500 Katyusha rockets into northern Israel, damaging scores of homes and buildings. Israeli officials estimate that the fighting cost the economy $ 100 million, including losses in work days, tourism and $ 6.3 million in direct property damage.
