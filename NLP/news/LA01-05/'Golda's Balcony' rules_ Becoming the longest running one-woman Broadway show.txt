Golda Meir rules.
"Golda's Balcony," the play by William Gibson about the Israeli prime minister, will become the longest running one-woman show in Broadway history on Oct. 3.
The play, which opened Oct. 15, 2003, at the Helen Hayes Theatre, stars Tovah Feldshuh, who was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance. The actress had previously played the role at off-Broadway's Manhattan Ensemble Theatre.
The previous record-holder was the Lily Tomlin comedy, "The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe," which opened on Broadway in September 1985 and ran for 391 performances.
"Golda's Balcony" already has announced a closing date, too. It will end its run Jan. 2, 2005, and then open in Los Angeles Feb. 1.

-"Avenue Q." Love blossoms among the twentysomething set - a group that includes puppets - in this very funny, adult musical comedy that has transferred from off-Broadway. Winner of the 2004 Tony Award for best musical. Golden. Telecharge.
-"Beauty and the Beast." For those who want a lavish, literal, live-action version of the delightful Disney animated feature, this is the ticket. Others may be content to rent the film. Lunt-Fontanne. Ticketmaster, a special Disney hot line, 212-307-4747.
-"Bombay Dreams." A bland version of the lavish London success that celebrates India's Bollywood musicals. Broadway. Telecharge.
-"Brooklyn The Musical." A young French woman comes to America in search of her father in what has been described as an urban fairy tale. Now in previews. Opens Oct. 21. Plymouth. Telecharge
-"Chicago." A potent revival of the 1975 Bob Fosse musical with a sassy Kander and Ebb score. Broadway's longest running musical revival - and deservedly so. Ambassador. Telecharge.
-"Dracula, The Musical." The old neck-biter is back, this time with songs by Frank Wildhorn, composer of "Jekyll & Hyde." Tom Hewitt plays Dracula. Belasco. Telecharge.
-"Fiddler on the Roof." A lovely revival of the classic Bock-Harnick and Robbins musical, starring Alfred Molina as Tevye and Randy Graff as Golde. Minskoff. Ticketmaster.
-"Forever Tango." The tango extravaganza from Argentina returns for one more visit. Shubert. Telecharge. Closes Nov. 28.

-"Golda's Balcony." A forceful Tovah Feldshuh, who received a Tony nomination for best actress, is the legendary Israeli prime minister in a fascinating one-woman show written by William Gibson. Helen Hayes. Telecharge. Closes Jan. 2, 2005.
-"Hairspray." The cult John Waters movie set in 1960s Baltimore has been turned into a hilarious, tuneful musical. Michael MeKean has inherited the role of full-figured Edna Turnblad, played in the film by Divine and on Broadway by Harvey Fierstein. Neil Simon. Ticketmaster.
-"I Am My Own Wife." The astonishing Jefferson Mays stars in Doug Wright's evocative play about a German transvestite who survived both the Nazi and communist regimes. Winner of the 2004 Tony Award for best play. Lyceum. Telecharge. Closes Oct. 31.
-"Mamma Mia!" The London musical sensation featuring the pop songs of ABBA makes it to Broadway. Die-hard ABBA fans will like it best; others may be puzzled. A special "Mamma Mia!" Telecharge number 212-563-5544.
-"Marc Salem's Mind Games on Broadway." Marc Salem knows what you are thinking - before you do. Monday evenings only when "I Am My Own Wife" is dark. Lyceum. Telecharge

-"The Phantom of the Opera." The one with the chandelier. The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical about a deformed composer who haunts the Paris Opera House is the prime, Grade A example of big Brit musical excess. But all the lavishness does have a purpose in Harold Prince's intelligent production. Majestic. Telecharge.
