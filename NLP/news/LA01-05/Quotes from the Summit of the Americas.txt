Quotes from the three-day Summit of the Americas:
"I still recall when we started negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that people would meet in dark rooms behind closed doors and the information on building that NAFTA was not reported in public - in general, you got the impression that people were ashamed of what they were doing. Today people are proud, proud of NAFTA and the results are impressive." Mexican President Vicente Fox.

Prime Minister Owen Arthur of Barbados.

Robert Cox, protester and president of the Sierra Club.
