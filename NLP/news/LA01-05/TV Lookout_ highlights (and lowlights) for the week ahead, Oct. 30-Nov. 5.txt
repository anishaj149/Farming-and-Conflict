The few dozen deaths so far from bird flu are all we need as a reminder of the threat imposed on humankind by infectious diseases.
"Rx for Survival - A Global Health Challenge" is a six-hour PBS documentary series examining critical health problems worldwide as well as people who are helping find solutions.
Natural disasters like the Southeast Asia tsunami and Hurricane Katrina have demonstrated how public health issues affect communities around the world.
And while millions of people in developing countries are routinely left vulnerable to preventable diseases like polio, diarrhea and malaria, industrialized nations are facing some 30 new or emergent diseases like SARS and West Nile virus, which have appeared within the past two decades.
In a jet-linked world, communicable disease can travel anywhere in a matter of hours, making an outbreak anywhere a threat to everyone. What will it take to get the fruits of medical science and disease prevention strategies to all the world's people? What will be the next health threat? And will the world be ready to fight it?
On "Rx for Survival," stories filmed in 20 countries tell of the fight, and showcase the wins.
Meanwhile, dramatic re-enactments capture pivotal moments of discovery, such as in 1796, when Edward Jenner proved that cowpox, a weak form of smallpox, could provide immunity against the world's most prolific killer disease.
Produced by the WGBH/NOVA Science Unit and narrated by Brad Pitt, "Rx for Survival" consists of these episodes:
- "Disease Warriors" chronicles the groundbreaking work of early researchers such as Jenner and Louis Pasteur. But today, even with global eradication of polio within reach, new diseases, like AIDS, demand vaccines as yet undiscovered. (It airs Tuesday, 9 p.m. EST; check local listings.)
- "Rise of the Superbugs" visits health care workers in Lima, Peru, as they fight a dangerous drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis that could have a global impact. (Tuesday, 10 p.m.)
- "Delivering the Goods" asks: What are the obstacles to providing care to populations in need? But it also points out that, despite millions dying needlessly each year, there are victories. Example: Women in Bangladesh embark on a revolutionary health care program transforming this country. (Wednesday, 9 p.m.)
- "Deadly Messengers" refers notably to the mosquitoes and other insects that inflict many of the world's most dangerous diseases onto unsuspecting victims. These so-called "vectors" pose a serious challenge to the scientists and health officials struggling to contain them. (Wednesday, 10 p.m.)
- "Back to the Basics" explores the building blocks of good health - clean water and nutrition - which are both often missing in the developing world. And elsewhere, an overabundance of nutrition - overconsumption - is causing an epidemic of obesity. (Thursday, 9 p.m.)
- "How Safe Are We?" contrasts the state of well-being for the developed world - which during the past 100 years has seen life expectancy more than double - with the emergence of new diseases, including AIDS, perhaps the most devastating epidemic in history. Meanwhile, scientists and health officials around the world prepare for a possible pandemic from bird flu. (Thursday, 10 p.m.)
Other shows to look out for:
- Building on the three-night "Rx for Survival," PBS' "Now" presents a two-part broadcast Friday that looks at U.S. global health policy. In the half-hour first segment (8:30 p.m.; check local listings), host David Brancaccio explores health issues in an interview with former President Carter. Then at 9 p.m., "Global Health: America's Response" examines the U.S. policy for HIV and AIDS from its beginning in the early 1980s through President Bush's plan, announced in 2003, to spend $15 billion treating people around the world.
- Hurricane Katrina has been called one of the worst natural disasters to ever strike America - a meteorological WMD. Now, the National Geographic Channel goes "Inside Hurricane Katrina." This two-hour special, airing 9 p.m. Tuesday, draws on newly released audio tapes of officials reacting to the crisis as well as new information about the timeline of events. It examines how this storm attacked as if an invasion force, cutting off the communications and transport links required for critical response, and eventually killing more than 1000 people and leaving thousands homeless. But was this devastation caused as much by human error as by nature's fury?
- Another Katrina special, this one on Court TV, airs at 10 p.m. Tuesday. "NOPD: After Katrina" came about when the storm hit New Orleans, and a production team was already on hand shooting a documentary about the city's police department. The filmmakers ride shotgun with two NOPD cops as they remain on duty, trying to restore order with few resources in a perilous, emotionally charged atmosphere.
