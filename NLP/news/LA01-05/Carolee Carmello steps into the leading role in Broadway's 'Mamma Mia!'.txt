"Mamma Mia!" has been one of Broadway's biggest hits since it opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on Oct. 18, 2001.
And it has gone through several casts. The latest important change occurs Oct. 20 when Carolee Carmello steps into the leading role in this musical celebration of the songs of ABBA.
Carmello, seen on Broadway in "Parade," "Urinetown" and the revival of "Kiss Me, Kate," will play Donna, a single mother whose soon-to-be-wed daughter wants to know the identity of her father. There are three possibilities.
Also joining the cast are Liz McCartney and Judy McLane, as Donna's best friends, and Daniel McDonald, as one of those would-be fathers.

-"Avenue Q." Love blossoms among the twentysomething set - a group that includes puppets - in this very funny, adult musical comedy that has transferred from off-Broadway. Winner of the 2004 Tony Award for best musical. Golden. Telecharge.
-"Beauty and the Beast." For those who want a lavish, literal, live-action version of the delightful Disney animated feature, this is the ticket. Others may be content to rent the film. Lunt-Fontanne. Ticketmaster, a special Disney hot line, 212-307-4747.
-"Bombay Dreams." A bland version of the lavish London success that celebrates India's Bollywood musicals. Broadway. Telecharge.

-"Chicago." A potent revival of the 1975 Bob Fosse musical with a sassy Kander and Ebb score. Broadway's longest running musical revival - and deservedly so. Ambassador. Telecharge.
-"Dracula, The Musical." The old neck-biter is back, this time with songs by Frank Wildhorn, composer of "Jekyll & Hyde." Tom Hewitt plays Dracula. Belasco. Telecharge.
-"Fiddler on the Roof." A lovely revival of the classic Bock-Harnick and Robbins musical, starring Alfred Molina as Tevye and Randy Graff as Golde. Minskoff. Ticketmaster.
-"Forever Tango." The tango extravaganza from Argentina returns for one more visit. Shubert. Telecharge. Closes Nov. 28.

-"Hairspray." The cult John Waters movie set in 1960s Baltimore has been turned into a hilarious, tuneful musical. Bruce Vilanch plays full-figured Edna Turnblad, mother of young Tracy Turnblad (Carly Jibson) whose life's desire is to appear on a television dance show. Neil Simon. Ticketmaster.
-"I Am My Own Wife." The astonishing Jefferson Mays stars in Doug Wright's evocative play about a German transvestite who survived both the Nazi and communist regimes. Winner of the 2004 Tony Award for best play. Lyceum. Telecharge. Closes Oct. 31.
-"Mamma Mia!" The London musical sensation featuring the pop songs of ABBA makes it to Broadway. Die-hard ABBA fans will like it best; others may be puzzled. A special "Mamma Mia!" Telecharge number 212-563-5544.

-"The Phantom of the Opera." The one with the chandelier. The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical about a deformed composer who haunts the Paris Opera House is the prime, Grade A example of big Brit musical excess. But all the lavishness does have a purpose in Harold Prince's intelligent production. Majestic. Telecharge.
