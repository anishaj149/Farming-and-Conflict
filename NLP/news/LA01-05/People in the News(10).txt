STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Brazilian singer Gilberto Gil and German romance singer Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau were named the 2005 winners of the Polar Music Prize for their contributions to music.
The award was founded in 1989 by Stig Anderson, manager of Swedish pop group ABBA, through a donation to The Royal Swedish Academy of Music. Announcement of the winners was made Monday.
Gil, who also is Brazil's culture minister, and Fischer-Dieskau will each receive $137,043. They are expected to travel to Sweden to collect the award on May 23 from King Carl XVI Gustaf.
The academy cited Gilberto, 62, for his "unflinching creative engagement in bringing to the world the heart and soul of the rich music of Brazil," and called him a "unique composer powered by immense talent and curiosity. A unique musical ambassador powered by firm cultural conviction."
Fischer-Dieskau, 79, is considered the premiere master of German lieder, or arts song, and his opera singing is regarded as some of the best worldwide. He was cited for "his unique artistry in every area of classical singing and for his unparalleled achievements as a penetrating and innovative interpreter of art songs in the German language."
The prize is typically split between pop artists and classical musicians. Previous winners include Paul McCartney, Isaac Stern, Bruce Springsteen, Pierre Boulez and Quincy Jones.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - "Love's Brother," a romantic drama directed by Jan Sardi, won the $50,000 grand prize at the Heartland Film Festival.
Sardi and actor Adam Garcia accepted the prize during a gala Saturday night at Conseco Fieldhouse. The festival honors filmmakers who create movies that portray positive, life-affirming messages.
"What I am always looking for as a writer and filmmaker is time to do the sort of stories that are important to me, and those stories aren't always the sort of no-brainers that studios want to develop and throw money at," said Sardi.
Garcia and Giovanni Ribisi portray two Italian immigrant brothers struggling to build new lives in post-World War II Australia, and one will not marry his girlfriend until the other finds a mail-order bride.
"It's really sweet and, for me, it's a very sedate and staid performance," Garcia said. "More importantly, it inspired me to the world of independent films."

LAS VEGAS (AP) - Sin City regular Paris Hilton has finally found a place she can call home here.
Hilton is opening Club Paris and designing her own personal suite at the Aladdin hotel-casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The property was recently purchased by an investment group led by Robert Earl, Planet Hollywood's founder and chairman.
"Las Vegas is hot, Planet Hollywood is hot and I wanted to be part of the newest, hottest resort in Las Vegas," Hilton, 23, said Saturday night at the Aladdin when the project was announced.
"I will see everyone back here on New Year's Eve when I officially open Club Paris in Las Vegas and Orlando on the same night! That's hot," exclaimed Hilton, who was wearing a black and gold Roberto Cavalli minidress and clutching her pet Chihuahua, Tinkerbell.
The Aladdin intends to rent out her suite when Hilton is not using it.
Earlier this month, it was announced in Orlando, Fla., that Club Paris, named after the star of "The Simple Life," planned to open on New Year's Eve at the Church Street Station in downtown Orlando.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - Actress and Arkansas native Mary Steenburgen and her actor-husband, Ted Danson, star of the "Becker" TV series, helped Heifer Project International celebrate its 60th anniversary.
The couple, who live in Little Rock, served as honorary stars of a fund-raising gala Saturday sponsored by the charity. Heifer is building a new international headquarters east of downtown Little Rock, next to the Clinton Presidential Library that is nearing completion.
Heifer works in 50 countries to provide animals ranging from snails and silkworms to elephants and water buffalo. The operation's goal is to provide the livestock to needy families so they can feed and support themselves. Recipients are required to give some of the animals' offspring to neighbors to pass on the gift.
Earlier in the day, Steenburgen and Danson showed up at the John Kerry-John Edwards campaign headquarters to thank workers for their efforts.
"I'm just talking the talk," said Danson, who has himself campaigned for the Democratic ticket. "You guys really walk the walk."
