Quotes from the Summit of the Americas on Saturday:
"True, (globalization) has brought prosperity to some, but we cannot deny it has destroyed the lives of others. … Until the hemisphere as a whole can enjoy the fruits of trade liberalization, we cannot proclaim its glory; until all the peoples of the Americas are free from hunger and fear of unemployment, we cannot celebrate the benefits of trade liberalization." St. Lucia Prime Minister Kenny Anthony.

"We have a great vision before us: a fully democratic hemisphere bound by goodwill and free trade. I'm here to offer my own ideas. I'm here to learn and to listen from voices to those inside this hall and to those outside this hall who want to join us in constructive dialogue. … Let us go forward together to launch the century of the Americas." President Bush.
