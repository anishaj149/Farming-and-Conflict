The United States' and Italy's differing versions of the events leading to Friday's fatal shooting of an Italian intelligence officer by American troops on a road in Baghdad. The officer, Nicola Calipari, was accompanying freed Italian hostage Giuliana Sgrena to the airport.
ADVANCE NOTICE?
- U.S. Army Gen. George Casey said Tuesday he had no indication Italian officials gave advance notice of the route of the vehicle U.S. soldiers fired on.
- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Wednesday that Calipari had notified an Italian liaison officer waiting at the Baghdad airport along with an American officer that they were on their way.
SPEED OR STOP?
- The U.S. military said Friday the vehicle carrying Calipari and Sgrena was "traveling at high speeds" and "refused to stop at a checkpoint." A U.S. patrol "attempted to warn the driver to stop by hand and arm signals, flashing white lights, and firing warning shots in front of the car," it said. "When the driver didn't stop, the soldiers shot into the engine block which stopped the vehicle, killing one and wounding two others."
- Berlusconi said Wednesday the car was traveling at low speed and stopped immediately when a light was flashed. Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini said Tuesday the car could not have been going more than 25 mph. He said a light was flashed at the car after a curve and that gunfire - lasting 10 or 15 seconds - started immediately afterward.
