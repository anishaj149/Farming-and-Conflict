World leaders adopted a 35-page document at a summit at the United Nations on Friday. The document:
- Resolves to create a Human Rights Council that would promote universal respect for human rights by September 2006.
But it drops proposals for members to be elected by a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly and doesn't bar known rights violators.
- Backs Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call for an internal ethics office and asks that the internal U.N. watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, be strengthened "as a matter of urgency." But it doesn't give Annan the authority to move jobs and make management changes that the United States, the European Union and others sought.
- Creates a Peacebuilding Commission to help nations emerging from war recover. It did not solve the issue of whether it reports to the Security Council or the General Assembly.
- Condemns "terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purpose..." Seeks a comprehensive terrorism convention but doesn't call for a definition of terrorism that rules out attacks on civilians, as Annan had wanted.
- Includes 16 pages on development, including commitment by all governments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
- Calls on nations to work together to protect civilians from genocide, war crimes and ethnic cleansing, but creates no new obligations to intervene in such cases, as some nations had sought.
