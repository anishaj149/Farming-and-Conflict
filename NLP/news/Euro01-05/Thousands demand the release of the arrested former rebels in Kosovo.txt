Thousands of ethnic Albanians spilled onto Kosovo's streets Tuesday to protest the arrests of former ethnic Albanian rebels accused of crimes committed after the province's war.
About 2,000 protesters gathered in Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, to demand the release of six former rebels, including Daut Haradinaj, a senior commander and the brother of a prominent ethnic Albanian leader.
The protest was the largest in a series of gatherings since the start of a recent roundup of former rebels last month. The six were arrested on charges of kidnapping and assault allegedly committed in June 1999. The crimes were committed against other ethnic Albanians.
Chanting "UCK" - the abbreviation for the now disbanded rebel group that fought the Serb forces in the province's 1998-1999 war - the protesters circled the town carrying Albanian flags and banners.
U.N. police units in riot gear set up positions around the capital and two helicopters monitored the crowd, but the demonstration was peaceful.
The United Nations and NATO have run Kosovo since ousting forces loyal to former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in 1999, following a 78-day alliance air war.
