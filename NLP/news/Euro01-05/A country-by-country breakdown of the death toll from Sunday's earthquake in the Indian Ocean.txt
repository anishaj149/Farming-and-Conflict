Officials said more than 22,500 people were killed in 10 countries in southern Asia and Africa after massive tsunami waves smashed coastlines Sunday morning. A breakdown of the toll so far:
- Sri Lanka: The official toll is 12,520. A military spokesman says 10,520 died in government-controlled areas. Tamil rebels say 2,000 were killed in their areas. More than 1 million people were displaced from wrecked villages.
- Indonesia: Government officials say about 4,991 people were killed. Aceh province on Sumatra island was near the quake's epicenter and was the hardest-hit part of the vast archipelago.
- India: An estimated 4,000 people died, the finance minister said. The worst-hit area was Tamil Nadu state. Huge waves left southern beaches strewn with bodies and flipped-over boats and cars. A toll put out by the international Red Cross in Geneva said 6,000 were killed in India.
- Thailand: The government said 918 persons died, 7,396 were injured and thousands were missing, mostly in idyllic southern islands packed with tourists from around the world. Among the dead was Poom Jensen, 21, the Thai-American grandson of King Bhumipol Adulyadej.
- Malaysia: At least 60 people, including an unknown number of foreign tourists, were dead, according to official reports. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated temporarily from hotels and apartments after the Indonesian quake was felt throughout peninsular Malaysia.
- Maldives: At least 43 people were confirmed dead and 51 were reported missing in this popular tourist destination.
- Myanmar: Thirty-four deaths were reported, including 12 when waves destroyed a bridge in Kawthaung, fishing industry and nonprofit officials said. Myanmar's military-run regime rarely provides details of disasters in the country.
- Somalia: In this African country nearly 3,000 miles from the quake's epicenter, a presidential spokesman said hundreds were killed and entire villages were wiped out. No exact death toll was available.
- Seychelles: Three people killed.
- Bangladesh: Tidal surges killed at least two children as a boat with about 15 tourists capsized.
