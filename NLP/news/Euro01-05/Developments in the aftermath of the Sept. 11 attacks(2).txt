Developments in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks:
-Afghan tribesmen continued to hunt for Osama bin Laden and his former Taliban protector, Mullah Mohammed Omar. They flushed holdout al-Qaida fighters from caves of the Tora Bora region in eastern Afghanistan.
-U.S. officials have taken custody of three al-Qaida fighters. The men are being held with American John Walker and Australian David Hicks, both of whom joined the Taliban, aboard the USS Pelileu in the Arabian Sea.
-Only a few hundred of the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 al-Qaida fighters were reported to have been killed or captured. There was no word on whether the rest had fled or whether initial estimates were wrong.
-Hundreds of refugees poured back into Afghanistan from Pakistan, where an estimated 3 million Afghans have been living.
-Hamid Karzai, the leader of Afghanistan's new interim administration, was in Rome on Tuesday for talks with the exiled Afghan king and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
-U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials believe the potential remains high for another terror attack although the Muslim holiday that prompted their most recent warning is passing. Tuesday was the third and final day of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, the celebration marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
