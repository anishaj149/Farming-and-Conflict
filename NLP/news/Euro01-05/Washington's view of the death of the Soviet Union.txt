Some American perspectives on the failed 1991 Soviet coup and the death of the Soviet Union:
---
"Did the intelligence community get it 100 percent right on the rapidity of the decline, the rapidity of the implosion of the Soviet Union? I would have to say no, nor did anybody else." - former President Bush.
---
"I … remembered seeing the five woebegone leaders of the conspiracy on television and they looked to me like a variation on Jimmy Breslin's book: This was 'The Gang That Couldn't Plot Straight.' I doubted if these bunglers could overthrow the dog catcher and take over the pound." - Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, now secretary of state.
---
"One of the things that's fascinating about the coup is that it was run by all of the people whom we in the West had feared - the people who were running the Soviet juggernaut. And it was botched in almost every conceivable way." - Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser.
---
"It was rather sad actually to see Gorbachev come back, almost seemingly unaware of what had happened. By the time of the end of the coup, Boris Yeltsin was the political authority in Russia and it was only a matter of time until Gorbachev had to step aside." - Condoleezza Rice, then on Bush's national security staff, now White House national security adviser.
---
"Gorbachev is a historical figure of enormous importance. When the time came in December of 1991, (he) sat on television, on Christmas night, and said: 'Seventy years - never mind. Let the hammer and sickle come down from above the Kremlin for the last time, and the tricolor go up,' and it happened peacefully." - Rice.
