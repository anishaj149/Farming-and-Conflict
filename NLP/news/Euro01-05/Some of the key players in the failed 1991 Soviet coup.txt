Some important figures in failed August 1991 coup:
---
BORIS YELTSIN: As Russian Federation president, he faced down coup attempt by communist hard-liners. His political standing diminished in 1993 after he turned tanks on rebel lawmakers in parliament, and a year later when he sent troops into Chechnya to launch the first war to hold on to the breakaway republic. Painful economic reforms pushed millions of Russians into poverty. Re-elected in 1996, he was soon sidelined by illnesses. He resigned Dec. 31, 1999. Now 70, he lives in seclusion with his family outside Moscow.
---
MIKHAIL GORBACHEV: As Soviet president, he carried out far-reaching reforms and won the Nobel Peace Prize. He resigned on Christmas Day 1991, when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. He established a think-tank, the Gorbachev Foundation, and traveled widely abroad. Despite international acclaim, he remained unpopular at home, where people held him responsible for the Soviet collapse. He won less than 1 percent of votes when he ran for the Russian presidency in 1996. Gorbachev, 70, is a fervent critic of Yeltsin, saying his economic reforms brought poverty, chaos and lawlessness, but he has been largely supportive of Vladimir Putin, Yeltsin's handpicked successor.
---
EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE: Resigned as Gorbachev's foreign minister in December 1990 in a dramatic protest against "coming dictatorship" - a statement later seen as a warning about a coming coup. He returned home to lead his native republic of Georgia after the Soviet collapse. Shevardnadze, 73, has faced civil strife, ethnic conflict, rampant crime and a ruined economy. He survived several assassination attempts. He has managed to bring some stability and has used his international contacts to bring Georgia closer to West. Says he won't seek third term in 2005 vote.
---
YEGOR GAIDAR: As one of a group of "radical reformers," Gaidar helped defeat the coup, then drafted Yeltsin's free-market reforms launched after Soviet collapse. He oversaw reforms as acting prime minister until December 1992 when Yeltsin dismissed him under pressure from parliament. Since then, Gaidar, 45, has remained on the political sidelines and holds no office.
---
VLADIMIR KRYUCHKOV: Former Soviet KGB chief who played a key role in organizing the coup. He was imprisoned with other plotters but later pardoned. At 77, he has remained out of the public eye except when he was a guest at Putin's inauguration in May 2000.
---
GENNADY GERASIMOV: Gorbachev's spokesman. Excellent English and smooth style made him a familiar face to foreign TV viewers, explaining "glasnost" (openness) and "perestroika" (restructuring). After several years in academic posts in United States, Gerasimov, 71, is back in Moscow and writes columns for Novoye Vremya, a political weekly.
