U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will attend the opening of the winter Olympics on Friday - the first time a U.N. chief will see the start of the games.
Annan was invited to the start of the winter games in Salt Lake City by International Olympic Committee Director General Francois Carrard, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckard said Tuesday.
On Saturday, Annan will speak at an Olympic-organized forum on youth development worldwide, Eckhard said.
Last week, Annan called on warring parties everywhere to honor an Olympic Truce and lay down their arms during the Feb. 8-24 games and allow athletes unhindered passage to get to the competition.
The truce is a tradition going back to the start of the Olympic games in Athens.
