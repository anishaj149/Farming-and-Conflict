The United Nations Postal Administration is releasing eight new stamps in its flag series. The stamps depict the flags of Slovenia, Palau, Tonga, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kiribati, Andorra and Nauru.
The flag series was launched in 1980 to honor the member states of the United Nations. Until 1989, 16 flag stamps were released each year. After 1989 the series was temporarily suspended because all flags had been commemorated. The series resumed as new nations were added, and with the eight new issues, the total number of flag stamps is 192.
Stamps will be available May 25. For first-day covers, call (800) 234-UNPA, or go to the Web site: http://www.un.org. 
To get a UNPA philatelic bulletin, write to the U.N. Postal Administration, PO Box 5900, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163-5900.

Distinguished authors are acclaimed on many U.S. postage stamps. In 1991, in a dual release, the U.S. Postal Service and Russian postal authorities issued a 29-cent stamp honoring famed writer William Saroyan as part of the Literary Arts series.
Saroyan's works include "The Human Comedy" and "The Man With the Heart in the Highlands." He died in 1981.

To celebrate the opening of the National Postal Museum in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Postal Service in 1993 issued four stamps.
The first stamp featured Benjamin Franklin, the first postmaster general appointed by the Continental Congress. Other stamps in the series depicted mail delivery starting in the early days. The denominations were 29 cents.
