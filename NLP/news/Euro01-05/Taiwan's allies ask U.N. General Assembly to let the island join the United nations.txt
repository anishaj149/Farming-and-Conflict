Taiwan's allies called for the economically powerful island to join the United Nations, claiming it will soon be the only country excluded from the world body in violation of the rights of its 23 million people.
Thursday's attempt to put Taiwan on the U.N. agenda is doomed to fail this year, as it has for the past 10 years, because of China's insistence that Taiwan is one of its provinces and not eligible for U.N. membership.
But it again put the spotlight on Taiwan's demand for international recognition.
Earlier this month, Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian angered Beijing by asserting that Taiwan and China are separate countries. He said the island should change its laws so that a public vote could be held on Taiwan's future.
With East Timor and Switzerland set to join the United Nations in September, Taiwan's supporters took up the argument, saying it would soon be the only "country" excluded from the world body. Actually, however, the Vatican, which is an independent state, will still only have U.N. observer status.
When it was based in China, Taiwan's former Nationalist government was one of the founding members of the United Nations in 1945. The Nationalist regime, representing the Republic of China, kept its U.N. seat after the Communist Party captured the mainland in 1949 and forced the Nationalists to retreat to Taiwan.
Anticipating a humiliating expulsion from the world body, the Taiwan-based government gave up its U.N. seat in 1971 after the United Nations accepted the communist government in Beijing as the sole legitimate ruler of China.
