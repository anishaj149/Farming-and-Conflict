Facts about two contenders in the runoff for Serbia's presidency:
VOJISLAV KOSTUNICA, 58, Yugoslav president.
- Won 30.91 percent of votes in the first round.
- A dour scholar and a staunch anti-communist, Kostunica pursued an academic career until he was kicked out of Belgrade University Law School in 1974 for his political views.
- In 1992, Kostunica split from his former ally Zoran Djindjic and the Democratic Party to found his own party - the Democratic Party of Serbia. He remains the party's leader.
- As a candidate of an 18-member pro-democratic coalition, Kostunica was appointed Yugoslav president in 2000 following the October revolt that unseated former leader Slobodan Milosevic.
- Kostunica is a moderate nationalist suspicious of the United States and opposed to the U.N. war crimes trial of Milosevic, arguing that his extradition was unlawful.
- He has campaigned on a platform promising honesty and less radical economic reforms than those advocated by Miroljub Labus, his main rival and a former ally.
- Kostunica might lose his present job next year under constitutional changes envisioned to transform Yugoslavia into a loose union of its two republics, Serbia and Montenegro.
MIROLJUB LABUS, 55, Yugoslav deputy prime minister.
- Won 27.46 percent of votes in the first round.
- In the 80's and early 90's, he lectured in economy at the Belgrade University Law School. Labus then worked as a World Bank consultant and for the United Nations Development Program in Bosnia.
- In the late 90's, Labus founded and led G17, an independent Serbian think-tank that later nominated him for the 2002 presidential race.
- After Slobodan Milosevic's ouster in the October 2000 uprising, Labus joined the Yugoslav government as the deputy prime minister. He has spearheaded country's efforts to negotiate loans and aid with the West.
- Labus advocates swift action to shut down aging factories and boost the stagnating economy.
- He accuses Kostunica of backtracking on promises he made two years ago about the pace of economic and political reforms.
- Labus, who enjoys support of Kostunica's main rival, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, pledges to lift the republic out of political scandals and economic hardship.
