Economists say you can't take the market out of the marketplace - the ups and downs of the Dow have much to do with how secure investors feel in the wider world.
Here are some market benchmarks, and a summary of what was going on elsewhere in the world that day.
-July 16, 1997: The Dow Jones Industrial Average breaks the 8,000 threshold; FBI agents close in on fashion designer Gianni Versace's killer; President Clinton appoints Henry Shelton chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.
-March 29, 1999: The Dow closes over 10,000 for the first time. The U.S.-led war against Serbia's "scorched-earth" policy in Kosovo regime is under way; eventually, it will lead to the ouster of strongman Slobodan Milosevic, and not a single American life will be lost to hostile fire.
-Jan. 14, 2000: The highest-ever daily Dow close, 11,722.98. Cuban mothers march for the return of Elian Gonzalez. The Supreme Court agrees to rule on gays in the Boy Scouts.
-Sept. 21, 2001: In its first week of trading after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Dow plunges 1,369 points - dipping below 9,000 for a while. The drop is its biggest ever weeklong fall.
-July 22, 2002: The Dow closes under 8,000 for the first time in four years. WorldCom files for Chapter 11; Israel drops a one-ton bomb on Gaza, killing a Hamas leader and a dozen civilians; Afghan President Hamid Karzai replaces his bodyguards with U.S. troops, fearing an assassination attempt; Iraq war talk intensifies in Washington.
