Voting rules for the conclave beginning Monday to elect a new pope:
---
WHO VOTES
Only the 115 cardinals under age 80 and well enough to vote. The dean of the College of Cardinals, Germany's Joseph Ratzinger, presides.
Two cardinals under 80 could not attend because of health reasons.
Electors vow total secrecy and promise to oppose interference by secular authorities or any others. They are forbidden to make any "pact, agreement, promise or other commitment" to win votes for or against a candidate. They must not be swayed "by friendship or aversion," media suggestions, force, "fear or the pursuit of popularity."

HOW THEY VOTE
Voting occurs in the Sistine Chapel by secret ballot. In early rounds, a two-thirds majority - 77 votes - is required for victory.
One ballot may be held the first day. If no pope is elected, two ballots in immediate succession without discussion occur each morning, and two each afternoon. After the twice-daily voting sessions, the ballots and any notes are burned.
If no one is elected after three days, voting pauses for up to one day. After seven more ballots, there's another pause, then seven ballots and another pause, then seven ballots. At this point if there's still no winner, a simple majority of cardinals may agree to elect the pope by a simple majority - 58 votes, or exactly half of the cardinals plus one.
