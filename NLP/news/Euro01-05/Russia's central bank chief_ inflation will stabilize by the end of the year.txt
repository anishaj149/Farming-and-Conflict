Russia's top banker said Friday that a higher than normal inflation rate was worrying, but that it would slow toward the end of the year.
Central Bank chief Sergei Ignatyev blamed the high rate on increased utilities rates at the start of the year, as well as rising prices for pork and beef.
While economists have also cited these as reasons, they say a loosening of fiscal policy will keep inflation high, as the government moves to increase budget sector wages and cash payments in place of welfare benefits that were annulled at the start of the year - sparking nationwide protests.
"In the next few months, the speed of inflation will decline and I think we will stabilize the situation by the end of the year," Ignatyev said at the start of a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies.
Last week, the International Monetary Fund said Russia would be hard put to keep inflation under 11 percent, while a target of 8.5 percent has been written into this year's budget.
The bank said that a decision to increase budget spending by some 12 percent would keep inflation high this year, and forecast 5.5 percent gross domestic production growth against the government's downwardly revised 5.8 percent.
