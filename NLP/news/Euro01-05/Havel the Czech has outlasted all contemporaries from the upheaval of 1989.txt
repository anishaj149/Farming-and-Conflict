Some of the people who became internationally known in 1989 and thereafter for their part in the downfall of the Soviet bloc:
---
CZECHOSLOVAKIA - Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright who led mass demonstrations that swept away communist rule in late 1989. Havel, now 66, became the first post-communist president of Czechoslovakia and then - when that country split in 1993 - the Czech Republic. He steps down Sunday.
Gustav Husak, the country's last communist president, resigned in December 1989. In 1969 he replaced Alexander Dubcek as Communist Party boss after a Soviet invasion crushed Dubcek's reformist government. Husak died in Bratislava Nov. 11, 1991.

HUNGARY - Arpad Goencz, a writer and World War II resistance hero, jailed by communist authorities for his role in the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising. Hungary's steady march toward democracy in the 1980s was crowned by the election of Goencz as president by parliament in August 1990. Retired in 2000 at age 78.
Hungary's last communist leader was Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth, a reformer who later became a banker in London. His 2001 attempt to regain the leadership of the Socialist Party - successors to the former communists - ended in failure.
---
POLAND - Lech Walesa, the shipyard electrician who led the Solidarity trade union movement in defiance of martial law and was elected president. Walesa, 59, lost 1995 elections to ex-communist Aleksander Kwasniewski and now lectures in the United States.
His arch-foe, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who ruled communist Poland until Walesa took over, is on trial for ordering troops to fire on protesting workers in 1970.
---
ROMANIA - Ion Iliescu, 72 and in his second term as president, was a minister under communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu who changed sides to become one of the key figures in Ceausescu's overthrow and execution in late 1989. His first term, 1990-96, was marred by slow pace of reforms and his role in enlisting miners to crush student protests. But since his re-election in 2000, Romania has moved closer to joining NATO and the European Union.
---
EAST GERMANY - Lothar de Maiziere became East Germany's first democratically elected prime minister, heading a conservative coalition that replaced Egon Krenz, East Germany's last communist leader, in early 1990. The lawyer, now 62, led the country into reunification with West Germany in October 1990. After a brief spell in post-Cold War politics, he now practices in Berlin.
East Germany's last communist leader, Egon Krenz, is serving a 6 1/2-year sentence, convicted of being partially responsible for the killing of East Germans trying to flee to the West during the Cold War.
---
BULGARIA - Zhelyu Zhelev, a dissident philosopher, became the first Bulgarian head of state to be picked by popular vote in January 1992. Zhelev, 68, now chairs a foundation focusing on Balkan problems.
Bulgaria's last communist ruler was Petar Mladenov, who became president in November 1989, overseeing the party's formal break with Stalinism. He resigned in July 1990 and died in 2000, aged 64.
---
SOVIET UNION - Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms and liberalization paved the way for the breakup of the Soviet Union's Eastern European satellite states, and ultimately for the demise of the Soviet Union itself. Gorbachev, 71 and a Nobel Peace prize laureate, now heads a charitable foundation. Gorbachev stepped down Dec. 25, 1991, as the Soviet Union collapsed.
Russia's first post-communist president was Boris Yeltsin, 72, who is retired after stepping down on New Year's Eve in 1999 and naming Vladimir Putin to succeed him.
