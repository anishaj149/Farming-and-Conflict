The Library of Congress is a misnomer. It would be more appropriate to call it the Library of the World.
The Library of Congress is acknowledged to be the largest library in the world, with more than 126 million items in three buildings. The collections include nearly 19 million books, 26 million recordings, 12 million photos and 56 million manuscripts.
It didn't start out that way. The Library of Congress was created in 1800 to provide "such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress."
That was when President John Adams approved an act of Congress that appropriated $5,000 for that purpose. Since then, the Library has grown from those modest beginnings to become a resource for all Americans, as well as government branches.
To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the prestigious Library of Congress, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 33-cent stamp in April, 2000, depicting the dome of the main building. The date "1800" and "USA" appear at the bottom. Previously (in 1982) the Postal Service released a 20-center portraying an aerial view of the Library buildings.
The Library had to endure two major fires before it evolved into its heralded place in history and architecture. After British troops burned the Capitol in 1814, Thomas Jefferson offered his personal library as a replacement for the burned materials. In 1815, Congress accepted his offer and paid him $23,950 for 6,487 books, thus laying a great foundation for a broad-based national library.
In 1851, a fire destroyed nearly two-thirds of the library's collection, which by then numbered some 55,000 books. Congress immediately approved funds to restore the buildings. Finally, in November, 1897, the Library of Congress found a new home on Capitol Hill - a magnificent Italian Renaissance structure now known as the Jefferson Building.
Today, the Library of Congress is the world's largest library and the nation's oldest federal cultural institution. Historians say it is an enduring reminder of the importance of free access to information in a democratic society.
Among the many treasures in the Jefferson Building are several versions of American composer John Philip Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever," including published scores, a music-box disk and an Edison wax cylinder - providing old-time material for all to see.
You can obtain copies of the 33-cent Library of Congress stamp by calling the Stamp Fulfillment Services of the USPS toll free (800) STAMP-24, or contact your local stamp dealer. If you are in Washington, you can visit the Library buildings, Mon.-Fri. 8:30 a.m. through 9:30 p.m., Sat. and Sun. 8:30 a.m. through 5 p.m.
