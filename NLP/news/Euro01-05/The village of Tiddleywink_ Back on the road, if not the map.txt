EDITOR'S NOTE - The "Read All About It" column is a reading comprehension exercise for children. It is written by Susan Fineman, a reading specialist in the New Haven, Conn., school district. This column is based on an AP story sent for use Feb. 21.
LONDON (AP) - Tiny but proud, the village of Tiddleywink is back.
Four years ago, the only road sign pointing to the southern English hamlet was knocked over in an accident.
Adding to its obscurity, the village was omitted from the current edition of the Collins British Atlas and Gazetteer.
Now, after campaigning by residents, Wiltshire County Council has put up two new road signs - a first step toward restored recognition for the cluster of eight cottages that make up the village. There was no immediate comment from the atlas publisher.
"It's good news, because people didn't know where we were," said Denis White, 79, a Tiddleywink resident for 40 years. "The name does make people smile. They usually say 'what a lovely address."'
Tiddleywink shares its name with the children's game - now spelled tiddlywinks - and originates with the 18th-century rhyming slang for "drinks."
Back when the old sign was up, Japanese and U.S. tourists used to like to have their photographs taken next to it, recalled Wiltshire County council member Jane Scott.
"Goodness knows what will happen when the visitors come back in the summer," she said.
