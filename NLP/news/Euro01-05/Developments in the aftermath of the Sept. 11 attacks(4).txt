Developments Thursday related to the Sept. 11 attacks:
 
- Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld says the Pentagon has chosen a U.S. Navy base in Cuba as the "least worst" place to hold Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners after they are removed from Afghanistan. He says the military has no plans to hold military tribunals at the Guantanamo Bay base.
- From a church altar a block away from the World Trade Center ruins, Rudolph Giuliani bid farewell as mayor Thursday, saying New Yorkers gave him the courage to lead the city beyond the fear and anguish of Sept. 11.
- Osama bin Laden, pale and gaunt after months of U.S. bombardment, calls for attacks against the U.S. economy in a videotape apparently made in recent weeks and broadcast in full on an Arabic satellite channel.
- European Union adopts expanded list of organizations and individuals it classifies as supporting terrorism and who will now likely face asset freezes and other sanctions.
