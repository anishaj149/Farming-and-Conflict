Dr. Wladimir Klitschko is happy to be defending his WBO heavyweight championship Dec. 1 at the Jacob Javits Center in Manhattan.
David Izon has to be happy to be challenging for some championship anywhere, although it is not the title bid he wanted and at one time thought he had - against WBC-IBF champion Hasim Rahman.
The fight, part of an HBO heavyweight doubleheader, was announced Tuesday by promoter Cedric Kushner.
In the other bout, also scheduled for 12 rounds, Lance Whitaker will fight Jameel McCline.
"I am ready for a big fight, that's why I'm here," said Klitschko, who said he completed his doctorate in sports science at the University of Kiev in January.
"This degree will help me," said the 25-year-old native of Ukraine, who lives at Hamburg, Germany.
So could this fight, which will showcase the 1996 Olympic super heavyweight champion to a national U.S. audience.
It will be the fourth defense for Klitschko (37-1, 34 knockouts), who won the fringe WBO title on points over Chris Byrd on Oct. 14, 2000, in Germany. It also will be his fifth fight in the United States, the last when he stopped David Bostice on the undercard of then-WBC-IBF champion Lennox Lewis' second-round technical knockout of Michael Grant on April 29, 2000, in Madison Square Garden.
While it will be Klitschko's third fight this year, it will be the first for 33-year-old Izon (27-3, 23 knockouts) since Oct. 20, 2000.
The 1992 Olympic heavyweight silver medalist from Nigeria, who lives at Pensacola, Fla., was supposed to challenge Rahman in August as part of doubleheader with a WBA title defense by John Ruiz against Evander Holyfield in Beijing.
A federal court judge in New York, however, ruled that Rahman must next fight Lewis, from whom he won the titles. The rematch is scheduled for Nov. 17 at Las Vegas. The China show fell through.
McCline (26-2-3, 16 knockouts), of Port Jefferson, N.Y., surprised a lot of people in his last fight when he stopped Grant in 43 seconds Aug. 21. In his last fight, Whitaker (23-1, 19 knockouts), of Granada Hills, Calif., knocked out Oleg Maskaev in the second rounds March 10.
