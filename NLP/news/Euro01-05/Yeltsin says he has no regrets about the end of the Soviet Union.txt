Former President Boris Yeltsin said in an interview broadcast Wednesday that he had no regrets about his role in the breakup of the Soviet Union, saying it was necessary for the preservation of Russia.
The interview was aired on state-owned RTR television on Russia Day, the holiday marking Russia's 1990 sovereignty declaration - a symbolic move ahead of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Yeltsin was chairman of the Russian parliament at the time.
"Every year I am more and more convinced that this was our only … chance to keep Russia whole," he said of the sovereignty declaration. "It put Russia on another, democratic, market-oriented path of development."
Yeltsin also praised the recent arms control treaty signed by Putin and President Bush but lamented the fact that the United States did not give in to Russian demands to destroy decommissioned warheads, rather than storing them.
Yeltsin, who was dogged by illness while in power but appeared healthy in the interview, expressed disappointment that the holiday is regarded by most Russians as just a day off from work.
"This is the birthday of Russia," he said. "As the birthday girl, she should be treated kindly."
Yeltsin resigned suddenly on New Year's Eve 1999, leaving then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in charge. Putin was elected the following March.
