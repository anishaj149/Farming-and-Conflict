Developments Thursday related to the Sept. 11 attacks:
- Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the United States must prepare for potential surprise attacks "vastly more deadly" than the Sept. 11 terrorist hijackings.
- Authorities questioned a 33-year-old Sudanese man about blueprints for the Japanese and Israeli embassies found when police searched his apartment in Hamburg, Germany.
- A judge suggested that a Jordanian questioned by a grand jury while shackled to a chair may have been unjustly coerced. Osama Awadallah, a 21-year-old student at Grossmont College in El Cajon, Calif., is charged with twice lying to grand jurors about his links to two of the suicide hijackers who crashed into the Pentagon.
- FBI Director Robert S. Mueller said he believes "sleeper cells" of terrorists exist within the United States, requiring the nation to remain on extended high alert.
- Terrified families huddled in basements or fled on foot in Gardez, Afghanistan, as rival warlords waged artillery battles for control of the strategic town. At least 43 people were killed and dozens injured.
