The government's indictment lays out a case based on allegations that Zacarias Moussaoui was in contact with and funded by al-Qaida plotters and made the same preparations as the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers.
According to the indictment:
In April 1998, Moussaoui was at the al-Qaida-affiliated Khalden training camp in Afghanistan.
On Sept. 29, 2000, Moussaoui contacted Airman Flight School in Norman, Okla., through a Malaysian e-mail account.
The next month, he received a letter from Infocus Tech, a Malaysian company, naming him as a marketing consultant for the United States, United Kingdom and Europe at $2,500 a month.
On Feb. 23, 2001, Moussaoui flew from London to Chicago. On Feb. 26, he deposited $32,000 cash in a Norman bank.
From that day through May 29, he attended classes at the Airman Flight School.
On May 23, 2001, Moussaoui e-mailed the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Miami.
On June 20, 2001, Moussaoui purchased flight deck videos for two Boeing 747 jetliner models from the same Ohio pilot store from which some 9/11 hijackers had purchased the same videos.
On July 10 or 11, Moussaoui used a credit card to pay Pan Am International Flight Academy for a simulator course in commercial flight training.
Between July 29 and Aug. 4, 2001, he used public phones in Norman to call a number in Duesseldorf, Germany.
On Aug. 1 and 3, purported Sept. 11 operations chief Ramzi Binalshibh wired $14,000 from Duesseldorf and Hamburg, Germany, to Moussaoui in Norman.
On Aug. 3, 2001, Moussaoui bought two knives in Norman.
On Aug. 10 and 11, he was driven to Minnesota and paid $6,800 cash on Aug. 13 to Pan Am International. He trained Aug. 13 and 15 at that company's Minneapolis facility on its Boeing 747 Model 400 simulator.
On Aug. 16, federal agents found Moussaoui had two knives, binoculars, 747 flight manuals, flight simulator programs, a paper referring to a handheld Global Positioning System receiver, a notebook containing two German telephone numbers and the "Ahad Sabet" alias used by Binalshibh, and a hand-held aviation radio.
In late August, one of the 9/11 hijackers purchased global positioning equipment and cockpit schematics for a Boeing 757. On Sept. 11, the hijackers had handwritten final instructions for a martyrdom operation on an airplane using knives.
