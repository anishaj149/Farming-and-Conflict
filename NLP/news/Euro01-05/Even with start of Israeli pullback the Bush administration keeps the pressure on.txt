The Bush administration brushed aside preliminary moves by Israel to withdraw its forces from Palestinian-held areas of the West Bank, keeping the heat on for a total pullout.
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer issued a statement Friday saying that President Bush was pleased with the first step of the withdrawal, urged all week by the administration, but called on Israel to complete it.
And at the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said, "We continue to urge the Israeli government to withdraw from all Palestinian-controlled areas."
Boucher said, "We think that step can lower tensions and help restore better trust and confidence" between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
Secretary of State Colin Powell also talked by telephone to Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, as he does routinely.
The White House statement said Bush wanted Arafat to "make a 100 percent effort" to reduce violence in the region. Boucher said U.S., U.N., European Union and Russian diplomats had met with the Palestinian leader on Thursday and urged him to immediately arrest whoever was involved in the assassination Oct. 17 of the Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeev.
Bush made the same request in a letter to Arafat last week. A White House spokesman, Sean McCormack, said Friday there had been no reply.
