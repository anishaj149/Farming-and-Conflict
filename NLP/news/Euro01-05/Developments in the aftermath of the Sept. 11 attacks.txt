Developments Wednesday related to the Sept. 11 attacks:
- The new Afghan government confirms that American bombs killed the Taliban's intelligence chief, Qari Ahmadullah. A tribal commander reports that negotiations are underway for the surrender of Mullah Mohammad Omar, the ousted Taliban supreme leader, but Pentagon officials say they doubt Omar is seeking to surrender.
- Zacarias Moussaoui declines to enter a plea to charges he conspired to murder thousands on Sept. 11. The judge set an October trial for the only man charged in the suicide hijackings despite defense concerns it would be too close to the anniversary of the attacks.
- The Transportation Department says a new security fee of $2.50 per flight, or $5 for passengers who change planes, will take effect Feb. 1.
- Tom Da Parma of the Uniformed Firefighters Association says the bodies of 10 firefighters and three civilians were pulled from the rubble of the World Trade Center as excavation crews opened up the lobby of one of the collapsed towers.
- Six German navy ships join the U.S.-led war on terrorism, leaving to patrol seas off the Horn of Africa in Germany's largest naval deployment since World War II.
- A coalition of groups kick off an immunization program to vaccinate 9 million Afghan children against measles. The campaign, which will cost more than $8 million, will begin in Kabul, Afghanistan, and continue for three months across the country.
