Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a friend and ally during Ronald Reagan's presidency, praised him Friday as the man who won the Cold War and reshaped the world.
"Others hoped, at best, for an uneasy cohabitation with the Soviet Union," Thatcher said in a tribute videotaped some months ago for Reagan's funeral.
Reagan won the Cold War "not only without firing a shot, but also by inviting enemies out of their fortress and turning them into friends," Thatcher said.
"The president resisted Soviet expansion and pressed down on Soviet weakness at every point until the day came when communism began to collapse beneath the combined weight of these pressures and its own failures," Thatcher said. "And when a man of goodwill did emerge from the ruins, President Reagan stepped forward to shake his hand and to offer sincere cooperation" to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Thatcher said that when Reagan's allies came under Soviet or domestic pressure, "they could look confidently to Washington for firm leadership. And when his enemies tested American resolve, they soon discovered that his resolve was firm and unyielding."
Thatcher attended the service at Washington National Cathedral but has given up public speaking after a series of small strokes.
Thatcher and Reagan forged a close personal and political bond during their years in office in the 1980s, united by their dislike of communism and belief in free-market economics.
