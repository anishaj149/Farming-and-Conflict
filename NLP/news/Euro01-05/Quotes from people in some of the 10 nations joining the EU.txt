Europeans comment on their countries' joining European Union:
---
"I'm looking forward to the moment when we'll be able to pass the border under the 'EU Citizens Only' sign. I've always felt like a second-class person when I see how smoothly they pass while we have to wait in long lines, our passports in hand. Perhaps it's not such a big thing, but it will have an important symbolic meaning for me." - Magda Pasiec, designer in Poland.
---
"One of our worries is that we'll have to compete with other, richer EU members to keep our skilled workers. Some of our best ones may be tempted to leave for better salaries abroad." - Aivaras Laukaitis, printer in Lithuania.
---
"Of course, life won't get better straight away. It's going to take us years to reach the living standards in some of the other countries. But in the long term it will be worth it, because it will mean our children have a good standard of living." - Andras Mate, bricklayer in Hungary.
---
"I'm not happy about EU entry. I think our business is still too weak to compete with EU companies. They are supported by their governments, sometimes in a hidden way. We will lose in the competition. We are losing already now because we have to invest heavily to catch up with their technologies." - Mariola Lisek, businesswoman in Poland.
---
"I'm very worried about our health service. Our doctors are paid so little. I think they will go to rich countries to get better pay, and where will that leave us? Things are bad enough as they are." - Dora Mezei, retired dry cleaner in Hungary.
---
"It's good we join, but we have to prepare ourselves for tough bargaining, for tough defense of our interests. The EU is not a club of good old uncles with money … I'm afraid that we don't know how to do it, that we will get lost in the corridors of the EU institutions." - Michal Wozniak, banker in Poland.
---
"I voted yes, but I'm already regretting it. People who own land might stay above water, but the ones who don't - who lease or rent - are going to go belly-up." - Valda Bismane, business owner in Latvia.
