Excerpts from the Connecticut Office of the Child Advocate and the Child Fatality Review Panel's investigation into the death of J. Daniel Scruggs.
---
THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM:
---
-"J. Daniel reported the abuse to his mother, to school authorities, to the DCF (state Department of Children and Families) investigative social worker, and to his probation officer. He and his sister both reported to the investigative social worker that his life had been threatened. J. Daniel's mother reported her concerns to the school… The teachers all expressed awareness that J. Daniel was a target for teasing and J. Daniel's schoolmates reported that he was teased all the time. Despite all the reports, his frequent conflicts with others, and his chronic truancy, no one ever addressed the issue of J. Daniel being bullied."
-"The school and J. Daniel's mother responded ineffectually to J. Daniel's needs for a full academic year and into the next before the school finally took mandated action and alerted the Department of Children and Families as well as the Superior Court for Juvenile matters. Until that time, there was no medical evaluation, no involvement of the school nurse, no therapist, and no intervention targeting hygiene. School personnel at all levels were aware of J. Daniel's appearance, behaviors and poor academic performance. He seemed to be held responsible for his circumstances."
-"There was no evidence that the boy had been referred to or seen by the middle school nurse for his incontinence at any time during the 6th or 7th grade. The review of J. Daniel's school records indicated that counseling appeared to occur only in response to specific incidents. It did not appear to be a formal process with goals, objectives or scheduled meetings."
-"The interviews with school personnel left a troubling picture of the school's response to J. Daniel's situation. The teasing and name-calling and refusal by children to be near him was considered by some to be justified. Many of the professionals interviewed by OCA intimated a level of acceptance for the way J. Daniel was treated. Their statement implied that it became understandable that other children would not want to be near J. Daniel, that they would make comments about his odor, because after all, he was bringing it on himself through his own anti-social actions."
-"Yet the teachers did not respond to J. Daniel's behaviors as possible pathology. Rather, they held him accountable for his "offensive" behavior and appearance. Their behavior could be interpreted as a quiet sense of relief when he was absent. They simply did not acknowledge or recognize that his behaviors suggested pathology beyond what the 11- and then 12-year-old could control."
---
THE ROLE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES:
---
-"DCF was the one agency that could step right into J. Daniel"s life and determine what was wrong. Instead, they ignored the evidence of dysfunction and chaos at home and the fact that a truant was scared to return to school. They did not follow up on reported threats against the boy's life. They ignored obvious symptoms of medical and mental health needs. When police arrived at the scene of J. Daniel's' suicide, the officers were aghast at the conditions the boy was living under, the same conditions a child abuse and neglect investigative social worker had visited just one month before.
-"The DCF investigative social worker scheduled another appointment with J. Daniel and his mother for three days later on December 7th, but that visit never occurred. The worker had promised J. Daniel and his mother that she would return with information about an alternative school and state such in the DCF case record. Despite that promise, and the documentation of her intentions, she never returned to the boy's home."
---
THE ROLE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT PROBATION OFFICE:
---
The probation officer (the PO) "made no referrals for counseling or other services. There was no indications that, as the summons had promised, the trained staff of the court had made an effort to identify services most appropriate to assist J. Daniel in solving his problem of truancy. The PO had no further contact with the school and there is no evidence that he had further contact with J. Daniel or his mother. There is also no evidence that the PO communicated with DCF.
-"J. Daniel's probation record contained very few documents, reflecting a brief open case and little involvement by the PO."
-"Had the probation officer investigated the situation with the school he would have learned that J. Daniel ceased coming to school and that his hygiene problems persisted. At his disposal was the option to bring J. Daniel back to court where a judge could not only compel the boy to attend school, but also compel him to submit to a medical and psychiatric evaluation as well as comply with any subsequent recommended therapies."
---
THE ROLE OF DANIEL'S HOME LIFE:
---
-"The mother requested assistance from school personnel, including the outreach worker. Ms. S. also attended PPTs (Planning and Placement Team meetings) where she voiced her concerns about the harassment that J. Daniel was experiencing from other students. There is no record that she took J. Daniel to a doctor or therapist of any kind for an evaluation of his symptoms in the period prior to his death. When he refused to go to school, she left him alone and unsupervised while she reported to work."
-"Ultimately Daniel lived in a home that did not facilitate good hygiene practices. The bathroom was filthy and the tub was full of clothes and toys. J. Daniel's mother failed to provide an environment in which he could maintain cleanliness and the DCF investigative social worker failed to inspect and respond to the problem."
