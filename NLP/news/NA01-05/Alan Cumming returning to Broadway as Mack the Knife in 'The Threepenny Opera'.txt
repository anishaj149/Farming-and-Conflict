Mack the Knife is coming back to Broadway, this time with Alan Cumming playing the notorious gang leader.
The Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill classic, which is being presented by the Roundabout Theatre Company, will open at Studio 54 in spring 2006. The production will also star Edie Falco as the hard-boiled prostitute Jenny and Nellie McKay as the sweet Polly Peachum.
"The Threepenny Opera" has had two major New York productions in the last 25 years or so, one at Lincoln Center in 1976 with Raul Julia and a second at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in 1989 starring Sting.
The Roundabout version will be directed by Scott Elliott and will have a new book and lyric translation from the original German by Wallace Shawn.
