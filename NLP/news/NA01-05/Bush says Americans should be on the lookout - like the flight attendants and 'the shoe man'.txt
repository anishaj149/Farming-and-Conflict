At a West Virginia machine plant on Tuesday, Bush described to workers what he means when he says everyday Americans must remain alert to the threat of terrorism.
"If you see something odd happening, let somebody know," Bush advised, using terror suspect Richard Reid as a case in point.
Reid was subdued by flight attendants and passengers on a Paris-to-Miami flight Dec. 22. He was accused of attempting to light a fuse protruding from his shoe. He has pleaded innocent.

Bush added, "We've got to be on our toes."
