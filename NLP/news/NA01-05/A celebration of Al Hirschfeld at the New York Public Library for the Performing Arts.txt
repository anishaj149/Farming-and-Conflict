There's now a Broadway theater named for artist Al Hirschfeld, who died earlier this year. And his original drawings of theater productions are never far from an art gallery or museum.
The latest exhibit, celebrating Hirschfeld's centennial, is now on view at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 40 Lincoln Center Plaza. The show consists of 10 pieces depicting Pulitzer Prize-winning plays including "You Can't Take It With You" by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart (1936); "A Streetcar Named Desire" by Tennessee Williams (1947), and "Death of a Salesman" by Arthur Miller (1949). The show runs through Aug. 29
