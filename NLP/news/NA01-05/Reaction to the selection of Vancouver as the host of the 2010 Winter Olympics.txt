Reaction to the IOC's selection of Vancouver as host of the 2010 Olympic city vote:
 
"It was a photo finish. But winning is winning." - Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, on Vancouver's narrow victory over Pyeongchang.
---
"The Games are not just venues, bricks and mortar. You need expertise, you need democracy, you need a stable economy, you need champions. Vancouver had all that." - IOC President Jacques Rogge.
---
"We knew that we are not a favorite but we didn't expect to fall out after the first vote," - Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.
---
"It's a surprise because our presentation was wonderful, the most wonderful of the three. Our image was very strong, an image of peace and universality. But some IOC members didn't understand the message." - Hahm Seung-heui, member of South Korea's national assembly.
---
"We are very disappointed that we didn't even make it past the first round because we were considered equal to Vancouver. They tell you it's a political sports strategy but we don't really know what that means." - Austrian Olympic downhill champion Franz Klammer.
---
"We won the world, so hooray!" - Chretien.
---
"It was the political card of 2012. I heard more about 2012 here than 2010." - International Ski Federation president Gian Franco Kasper.
---
"There was a collective movement in Europe. The second round was a 2012 issue. The continental circulation is working." - Hahm Seung-Heui, member of South Korea's National Assembly.
---
"I don't know if politics were really involved. I think all three candidates were viable candidates to hosts the 2010 Games." - Canadian hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.
---
"The IOC is about athletes, and the members think in terms of athletes. There are 25 Olympic champions and they will go for sport, not go for politics." - Rogge.
---
"I am one of those who was caught up by the Olympic dream as a child and my life was transformed. We want the Olympic dream to come alive in a new way in Canada and around the world." - double Olympic speedskating gold medalist Catriona Le May Doan.
---
"It's such a pity. Our hosting would have helped bring forward unification with North Korea." - Nam Sang-ryul, a Pyeongchang resident.
