A little surfing on the Web can help you plan a vacation to the Lake Powell area, the scenic swath of Western landscape along the Colorado River in northern Arizona and southern Utah.
What's the big deal about Powell? The scenery. Go to the Web site of the city of Page, Ariz., home of the lake's Glen Canyon Dam - http://www.cityofpage.org/ - and check out the extensive photo gallery. While you're there, look for "Recreation" under the "Quick Links" menu to learn about the Rim Trail, an 8-mile scenic trek around the edge of town that provides views of some of the spectacular landscape around the lower end of the lake.
For more helpful details on the town, the Page entry from About.com - http://gocalifornia.about.com/od/azpage/ - has links to motel and campground information. Then find the link to information on Antelope Canyon, a colorful, twisty slot canyon. The canyon is a Navajo Nation park and a guide is required; this Web site has links to guides, along with tips for photography. Another guide company that isn't listed is Antelope Canyon Tours - http://www.antelopecanyon.com/ - which has its own stunning photo gallery.
The Glen Canyon National Recreation Area - http://www.nps.gov/glca/ - stretches for hundreds of scenic miles around the lake. If you plan to take your own boat, be sure to read the "Lake Level Updates/Ramp Conditions." Then click on "In Depth" for information on the lake's marinas and other commercial services, and for details on hiking, camping and fishing.
One of the best-known landmarks in the area is Rainbow Bridge National Monument - http://www.nps.gov/rabr/ - home to the world's largest natural bridge. It's accessible only by boat across Lake Powell or by a 13-mike hike across Navajo Nation land.
The Lake Powell and Page visitors guide - http://www.canyon-country.com/lakepowell/ - is a couple of months out of date on the drought's effect on the lake's water level, but there's plenty of other information to help with your plans. The "Guide to Trip Planning" is a helpful multipage summary of the scenery, climate, best marinas if you want to take your boat or hire a houseboat, and best times of year. It's not crowded in the winter, when the scenery is just as good as the rest of the year; fishing is good in the spring, and the lake is warm enough for swimming in the late summer. There are sections on renting houseboats to explore the lake's many inlets and side canyons, and on fishing regulations.
Read a comprehensive survey of the area at the National Sites section of Utah's state tourism site - http://www.utah.com/nationalsites/ - where you need to look for the link to "Glen Canyon/Lake Powell." Be sure to click on "Related Articles" for extensive information on houseboating around the lake.
Elsewhere in the region, a guide to Northern Arizona - http://www.northern-arizona.com/ - will help you plan visits to Flagstaff, Sedona, the Navajo Nation and the Grand Canyon. And another section of the Utah state travel Web site - http://www.utah.com/destinations/ - will take you to information on areas including the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Zion National Park.
