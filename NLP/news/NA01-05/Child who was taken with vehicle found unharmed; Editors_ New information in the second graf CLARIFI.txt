Police in northern Virginia were searching for a car theft suspect Wednesday evening who drove away in a vehicle while a toddler slept inside.
The car was taken from the parking lot of an automotive repair shop in the 3100 block of Colvin Street where a woman had gone to visit her husband just after 6:30 p.m. The man saw the car being driven away a few minutes later.
The couple contacted the Alexandria Police Department and informed them that the niece and vehicle were missing.
Alexandria police began an immediate search for the vehicle with help from the Fairfax County Police Department's helicopter. Arlington County Police were also informed.
Police received an anonymous tip informing them that the child could be found at the Rosslyn Metrorail station. Arlington County police found her there unharmed. She was reunited with her family.
Police are still looking for the gold 1996 Nissan Maxima. The car has Virginia tags bearing the number J-E-K 75-98.
