LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - You can tell a lot about a president by who gives him a ton (or, more precisely, about 20 tons) of bricks.
Eight months before they're laid in the ground in front of Bill Clinton's presidential library, orders for 8,000 brick pavers show that home run king Hank Aaron is a two-brick Clinton supporter and swimsuit supermodel Christie Brinkley is a fan, too.
They are among donors from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 10 foreign countries to support the Clinton Foundation's most successful fund-raising effort to date, foundation president Skip Rutherford said.
"Nothing compares to this," said Rutherford, who previously sold library membership cards and an opportunity to sign the last structural beam put in place.
At $100 a brick, the nonprofit Clinton Foundation made $800,000 from the direct mail campaign. The library, museum, graduate school of public service and 30-acre park in downtown Little Rock have a $160 million price tag. Opening day is Nov. 18.
The bricks will pave the walkway surrounding Celebration Circle, a cul-de-sac in front of the main entrance.

NEW YORK (AP) - Katharine Hepburn's fans will get a glimpse into her personal life when a trove of her possessions, including clothes, furniture and love notes from Howard Hughes, goes on sale at Sotheby's in June.
The sale, which is expected to fetch about $1 million, includes a lock of Hepburn's baby hair and the dress she wore to her 1928 wedding to Ludlow Ogden Smith. The marriage lasted six years.
"We are delighted to have the opportunity to offer property from the estate of Katharine Hepburn," said Leila Dunbar, director of Sotheby's collectibles department. "Her iconic status as one of Hollywood's most important actors is only matched by her zest for life at its fullest."
The sale is set for June 10-11; the items will be on view June 3-9.
Memorabilia from her career includes press kits from classic films such as "Bringing Up Baby" and "Holiday," as well as contracts for "The Rainmaker" and "Rooster Cogburn."
There's a signed photograph of Hepburn as Rose in "The African Queen" accompanied by another photograph of her co-star Humphrey Bogart opening a crate of gin. The Bogart photograph is inscribed, "For Kate who disapproves - Bogie."
Also included are more than 20 Western Union telegrams and drafts between Hepburn and Hughes from their 1930s romance as well as passports and address books that list the numbers of Laurence Olivier and Hepburn's longtime love, Spencer Tracy.
There are also suits, coats, dresses, pants, hats, luggage, skis, golf clubs and furniture from Hepburn's homes in Old Saybrook, Conn., and Los Angeles.
Hepburn, an intensely private star who won four Oscars during her 60-year career, died last June at 96 at her home in Old Saybrook.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Real-world labor issues apparently were too much for the producers of a popular MTV reality show.
Bunim/Murray Productions said Tuesday it had given up plans to tape the 15th season of "The Real World" in Philadelphia. Taping had been set to begin in three weeks.
The production company had angered labor unions by hiring a nonunion company to renovate the former Seamen's Church Institute in Old City, where it planned to have seven strangers live together and have their lives videotaped. Members of the building trades unions picketed outside the building.
A Bunim/Murray spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the one-sentence statement issued Tuesday: "After considerable evaluation, we are disappointed to announce that Bunim/Murray productions has decided not to shoot 'The Real World' in Philadelphia."
It was unclear whether MTV would choose another city or delay its shooting schedule. A spokeswoman for the New York cable network declined to comment Wednesday and referred questions to Bunim/Murray in Van Nuys, Calif.
"I've got kids looking at me like I killed Santa Claus," Pat Gillespie, president of the powerful Building Trades Council, said Wednesday. "Look, they come into our town and make a decision to avoid union workers. Whether they were prepared for what would happen, it was a conscious decision that they made."
