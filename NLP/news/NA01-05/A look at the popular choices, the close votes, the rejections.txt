Since President George Washington nominated John Jay on Sept. 24, 1789 - and the Senate confirmed him by voice vote - a total of 108 justices have served on the Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed many with little or no dissent - 68 on voice votes. Others won Senate approval by the narrowest of margins.

In 1862, the death of Justice Peter V. Daniel created a vacancy on the high court. While President Abraham Lincoln was weighing his choice, 129 of 140 House members and all but four senators signed a petition urging him to nominate Samuel F. Miller of Iowa. Lincoln nominated Miller and the Senate confirmed him by voice vote 30 minutes later.
-Members of Congress pressed President Ulysses S. Grant to fill the vacancy created by Robert C. Grier's resignation with Edwin M. Stanton, a former secretary of War. Grant nominated Stanton, who was confirmed immediately, 46-11, but he died four days later.
The closest vote in recent times was confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas, whose nomination was approved, 52-48, in 1991. President Woodrow Wilson's nomination of Louis Brandeis in 1916 received several dissenting votes, but Brandeis was confirmed, 47-22.
President Grover Cleveland's nominee, Lucius Lamar, won Senate approval in 1888 on a vote of 32-28. Stanley Matthews, President James Garfield's pick for the high court, was confirmed by a single vote, 24-23, in 1881.
President James Buchanan nominated Nathan Clifford on Dec. 9, 1857 and the Senate confirmed him, 26-23.
The Senate has rejected more than a dozen nominees, including three in the last 40 years. President Reagan's nominee, Robert Bork, failed to win confirmation on a Senate vote of 42-58, as Bork's conservative ideology doomed his nomination in 1987.
The Senate rejected President Nixon's nominees, G. Harrold Carswell and Clement Haynsworth Jr.; Carswell failed 45-51, Haynsworth, 45-55.
Financial conflict of interest questions and opposition from labor and civil rights leaders sank Haynsworth's nomination. Carswell was undone by his civil rights record and criticism that he lacked the skills for the high court.
In defense of Carswell, Nebraska Republican Sen. Roman Hruska said, "Even if he is mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they?"
President Herbert Hoover's pick, John Parker, was rejected, 39-41. Two of President Grover Cleveland's nominees, Wheeler Peckham and William Hornblower, failed in the late 1800s. The Senate rejected Peckham, 32-41, and Hornblower, 24-30.
One of the closest votes was on President James Buchanan's nomination of Jeremiah Black. The Senate rejected Black, 25-26.
President James Madison's selection of Alexander Wolcott was soundly rejected by the Senate, 9-24.
