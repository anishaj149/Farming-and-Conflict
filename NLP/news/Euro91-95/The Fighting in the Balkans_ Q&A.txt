WHAT CAUSED YUGOSLAVIA'S CIVIL WAR?
The collapse of communism in eastern Europe led to independence campaigns in Croatia and Slovenia, two of the six former Yugoslav republics. War broke out after the two republics declared independence on June 25, 1991. Fighting quickly died down in Slovenia, but later spread to Croatia. After Croatia, the war moved to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
WHO IS FIGHTING WHOM?
In Croatia, ethnic Serbs are fighting Croats. In Bosnia-Herzegovina ethnic Serbs, long backed by the federal Yugoslav army, are pitted against ethnic Croats and Slavic Muslims.
WHY ARE THEY FIGHTING?
Ethnic Serbs in both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina oppose the republics' independence. They say they want to remain tied to Serb-led Yugoslavia, which is now composed of only Serbia and its tiny ally Montenegro.
WHY IS THERE CONTINUING ETHNIC RIVALRY?
Tensions between Croats and Serbs are fanned by memories of the World War II slaughter of Serbs by a Nazi puppet regime in Croatia. During the war, thousands of Croats were also killed by Serbs. Muslims fought both Serbs and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1941 to 1945.
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE CURRENT CIVIL WAR?
At least 10,000 people have died in Croatia and at least 5,700 in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But these figures are incomplete.
WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF REFUGEES?
An estimated 1.2 million people have fled their homes in Bosnia-Herzegovina; 700,000 others have been displaced in Croatia. Many of the refugees have been driven from their homes by Serb militias in order to create "ethnically clean" areas.
WHAT IS THE WORLD DOING?
For a long time the Western world look paralyzed at what was unfolding in the former six-republic Yugoslav federation.
The European Community and, increasingly, the United Nations have tried to mediate the conflict. Many cease-fire pacts have been violated by all sides in the fighting.
WHAT ROLE IS THE U.N. PLAYING IN TRYING TO HALT WARFARE IN BOSNIA?
The U.N. Security Council on May 30 imposed an economic and oil embargo on Serbia and Montenegro, which it holds responsible for the fighting in Bosnia.
In addition, The Security Council on June 8 approved sending 60 military observers to Sarajevo as a first step toward making relief flights possible to the besieged Bosnian capital.
A 14,000-member U.N. force is being deployed in Croatia, but its job is only to keep a cease-fire established in January.
