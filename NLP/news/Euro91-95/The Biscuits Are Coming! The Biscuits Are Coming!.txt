The Cold War has ended not with a bang, but a crunch.
Britain says it plans to give away thousands of tons of crackers from a vast stockpile of food that was intended to help Britons recover from a war that never happened.
Nearly 200,000 tons of food has been squirreled away for nearly 50 years in depots around the country.
Agriculture Minister John Gummer said in a statement Wednesday that the crackers will be sold, returned to manufacturers or handed out to charities.
Besides crackers - or biscuits as they are called in Britain - the stockpile includes flour, fat, sugar and ready-to-eat meals.
An Agriculture Ministry spokeswoman said perishable food was replenished from time to time, but some of the crackers are up to 40 years old.
The spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British practice, said one official even went so far as to sample an old biscuit.
The verdict: "Quite nice," she said.
