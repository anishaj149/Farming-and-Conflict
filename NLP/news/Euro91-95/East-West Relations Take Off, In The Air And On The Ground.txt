Soviet air force jets that once would have scrambled Britain's air defenses on sight have entered British air space to a much friendlier reception.
The Russian Knights, the Soviet Air Force's flight precision team, touched down Wednesday at the home of their Royal Air Force opposite numbers, the Red Arrows, in Scampton, 170 miles north of London.
The Russian team, who fly supersonic Sukhoi-27 jet fighters, were formed after the Red Arrows visited the Soviet Union last year. They will perform their aerobatics at various events throughout Britain before returning home Monday.
They flew into RAF Scampton flanked by four Tornado F3 jet fighters and landed to the strains of the RAF band playing "Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines."
