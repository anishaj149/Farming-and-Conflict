What a choice for reporters: traipse through Paris with President Clinton or tromp through the sewers with Vice President Al Gore.
Gore is scheduled to visit the Potomac Filtration Plant of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission on Thursday to underscore the administration's opposition to proposed Republican budget cuts in programs designed to protect the environment.
Clinton, meanwhile, will be in Paris to witness the signing of the Bosnian peace agreement.
"The choice is between tromping around in sewers with the vice president of the United States and being with the president of the United States in Paris - difficult one, I do admit," said White House press secretary Mike McCurry. "I'm sure you will make your judgment accordingly."
No sewers for McCurry.
He is accompanying the president to Paris.
