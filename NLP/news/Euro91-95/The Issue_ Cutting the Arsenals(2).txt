Here are the views of the major presidential candidates on the question: "U.S. and Russian leaders have announced new cutbacks in their countries' nuclear arsenals. How far down could the U.S. arsenal be drawn and still provide an adequate defense?"
 
 DEMOCRATS
-Jerry Brown: "I favor a reduction of 50 percent over 5 years in all defense spending."
 
 -Bill Clinton: "I believe we can negotiate much lower limits on nuclear warheads in light of recent developments in the former Soviet Union. It is important, however, that we retain a capability that will deter any possible nuclear threat over the coming decade."
-Tom Harkin: "Nuclear weapons serve no useful military purpose, except to deter others from using nuclear weapons. We should take this opportunity to remove and destroy all tactical nuclear weapons from the former Soviet republics, and to eliminate as many of the 11,000 ex-Soviet strategic (long-range) nuclear missiles still capable of reaching American cities and bases. I recommend no more than 1,000 strategic nuclear warheads on each side, which is more than adequate for deterrence."
 
 -Bob Kerrey: "We can clearly reduce our strategic nuclear forces significantly, even below the levels proposed by the president. Our defense would be amply assured by strategic forces roughly in the neighborhood of 3,000 START countable warheads. At the same time, as president, I would make significant reductions in our tactical nuclear forces from the current level of roughly 10,000 to only several hundred, based entirely in the United States."
 
 -Paul Tsongas: "It is critical for the United States to continue reducing nuclear weapons. I would favor cutting our arsenals as much as possible while maintaining weapons levels comparable with the other nuclear powers. Any cuts must be mutual and verifiable."
 
 REPUBLICANS
-George Bush: The Bush administration has announced plans to cut the number of strategic nuclear weapons by more than half, from 9,500 to 4,700.
 
 -Patrick Buchanan: Has not taken a public stand on cutting the nuclear arsenal.
 
 -David Duke: "In addition to an adequate missile defense system like SDI, a treaty which guaranteed complete access to every nation's nuclear facilities could allow us to reduce our arsenal by up to 90 percent in the long term and would still provide adequate national defense against rogue governments and nuclear blackmailers."
