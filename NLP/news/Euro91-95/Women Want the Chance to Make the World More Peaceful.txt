Can women ultimately make the world a more peaceful place?
"War is man's game - and politics as well," said Sonja Licht, a feminist peace activist who heads the Soros Yugoslavia Foundation, set up by the billionaire philanthropist George Soros.
"I don't want to say women would be better in politics, but they can't be worse. So we should give them a chance," Licht said.
But in former Yugoslavia, as in many other countries, women are still far from political power. Within the peace movement, there is a debate over whether women should work inside or outside the government.
Lepa Mladjenovic, a founder of the anti-war group Women in Black and head of the Autonomous Women's Center Against Sexual Violence, believes activists in Yugoslavia should try both, although it's very difficult to deal with the government of President Slobodan Milosevic.
"If you know they have made concentration camps, ethnic cleansing, killings … it's so difficult to try to talk to them," she said.
"They see you as a traitor because if you are not a nationalist, you are an enemy of the Serb state. So, therefore, our influence is really slow. It is little."
