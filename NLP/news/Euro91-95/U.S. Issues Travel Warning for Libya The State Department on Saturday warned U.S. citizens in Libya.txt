U.S. Issues Travel Warning for Libya  The State Department on Saturday warned U.S. citizens in Libya to leave that country immediately. The warning came as Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi rejected U.N. demands to hand over suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing and urged Muslims worldwide to come to Libya's defense.

More than a million foreigners live in Libya, including more than 500 to 1,000 Americans. Most work with oil companies or as consultants with construction projects and are scattered about the country.
The United States has no embassy in Libya and U.S. passports are not valid for travel to, in or through the country unless specifically endorsed by the U.S. government, the State Department said.
Two Libyans are wanted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. Britain and the United States last year issued warrants for the pair, said to be Libyan government agents.
The U.N. Security Council voted last week to impose air, arms and diplomatic sanctions April 15 unless the suspects are handed over.
The State Department said in a statement that the United States cannot predict if or when Libya will comply with the U.N. demands.
"After April 15, unless Libya complies fully with U.S. Resolution 731, air links will be discontinued, and it will be more difficult the leave Libya," the department said.
On Thursday, protesters in Tripoli held sometimes violent demonstrations at the embassies of countries supporting the sanctions. On Friday, a leading cleric suggested in a sermon broadcast on Libyan TV that the citizens of those countries should be expelled and their companies nationalized.
