Facts and figures on the area of the Russian Far East hit Sunday by an earthquake with a 7.5 magnitude.
 
 ---
THE AREA: The quake struck just off the coast of Sakhalin Island, eight time zones and 4,000 miles east of Moscow.
About 750,000 people live on the island. The area was closed to foreigners for many years during the Soviet period because of its sensitive military bases. The quake was centered on the northern tip of the island, destroying the town of Neftegorsk, a town of 3,500 located 40 miles northwest of the epicenter.

EARTHQUAKE ACTIVITY: Two other major quakes, measuring magnitude 7 or greater, have shaken the region in the past eight months. Last Oct. 4, a magnitude 8.2 quake struck Russia's disputed Kuril Islands 600 miles southeast of Sunday's epicenter, killing at least 10 people. On Jan. 17, a 7.2 quake devastated Kobe, Japan, to the south, killing 5,500 people.

RESOURCES: Sakhalin is rich in natural resources - oil, gas, coal, timber and fish. One-fifth of Russian's entire fish catch comes from the waters around Sakhalin. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, it has opened itself to Western oil and gas executives and Japanese and Korean businessmen.

HISTORY
Since the late 1860s and later in the Soviet era, Sakhalin served as a large prison camp and place of exile for criminals and political dissidents. Neighboring Japan occupied the southern tip of Sakhalin until the Red Army forced out the Japanese troops at the end of World War II. The population is now mostly Russian, although there is an important ethnic Korean community.
