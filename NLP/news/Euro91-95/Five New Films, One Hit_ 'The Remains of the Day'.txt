"The Remains of the Day," an elegant drama set in England on the eve of World War II, opened strongly at the box office, outdoing by some measures such low-brow fare as "Look Who's Talking Now."
"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" was the No. 1 movie over the weekend, making $ 7.7 million in its fourth week of release, while "Remains of the Day," playing in just a few theaters, made $ 1.5 million, Exhibitor Relations Co. reported Monday.
The film about a butler's devotion stars Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Although it finished 13th overall, glowing reviews and strong word-of-mouth may give it the same success enjoyed by last year's "Howards End," which had the same co-stars and was produced by the same team.
"Remains of the Day," one of five films making debuts over the weekend, averaged $ 16,266 per theater location. By comparison, the sequel "Look Who's Talking Now" made $ 4 million in its premiere for sixth place, but averaged an anemic $ 2,165 per theater location.
The worst debut was that of "A Home of Our Own." The family drama starring Kathy Bates made a weak $ 808,000 for 17th place.
"Flesh and Bone," a thriller starring Meg Ryan and husband Dennis Quaid, opened at No. 2 with $ 4.5 million. "Robocop 3" made $ 4.3 million in its first weekend for third place.
Here are weekend's top 20 films, according to Exhibitor Relations. Estimated ticket sales are from Friday through Sunday, with distributor, weekend gross, number of North American theater locations, average per location, total gross and number of weeks in release.
