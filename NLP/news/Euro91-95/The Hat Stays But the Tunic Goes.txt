The London bobby is trading in his dark blue tunic for a sweater and heavy hooded jacket, but the winds of change won't budge the distinctive pointed helmet from his head.
A Scotland Yard committee announced the change Monday after reviewing whether to start using American-style peaked caps, as the northern city of Manchester did recently.
"The helmet is staying for safety reasons, but the tunic will be less frequently used and then will only be worn on ceremonial occasions," said a Scotland Yard statement.
The Prussian-style helmet, introduced in 1863, gives better protection against blows on the head, the committee said. Female members of the London police force wear caps.
