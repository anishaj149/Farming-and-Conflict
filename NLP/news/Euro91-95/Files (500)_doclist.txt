1. Sealed Papers of James Joyce Released A treasure-trove for James Joyce scholars opened Sunday when the National Library made public a collection of letters and papers retrieved by a friend from Nazi-occupied Paris.The archive, which includes Joyce's correspondence with T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and Henri Matisse, is a "priceless addition to our knowledge," said Prime Minister Albert Reynolds at a ceremony at the library.But the opening of the archive was clouded by the recent release of diplomatic documents indicating that Ireland did nothing to protect the life of Paul Leon, who retrieved the Joyce papers.

7. Books and Authors: True Confessions - Louis Begley In Peacetime "One had to talk, one could not only talk about books, one had to be ready to talk about oneself. Which self?
