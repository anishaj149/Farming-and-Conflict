The keepers of the Doomsday Clock are moving back its hands to reflect the decreased threat of global nuclear war, but they won't say how much.
The new setting will appear in the December issue of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
The clockface appears on the cover each issue and reflects the editors' judgment of how far away the world is from nuclear destruction.
The clock has stood at 11:50 p.m. since March 1990, when it was moved back from 11:54 p.m. to reflect Eastern Europe's revolutionary changes and Mikhail Gorbachev's reformist policies.
During the publication's 46-year history, the clock came closest to nuclear midnight - 11:58 p.m. - in 1953, after the United States tested the hydrogen bomb.
"We've made a decision about moving the hands back, but I can't confirm how far it will be," Alan Lonstein, assistant editor, said Monday.
