'Tis the season for major toy purchases, when parents have an excuse to re-visit the wonderlands of their own childhoods. Here are some of the items they'll be stashing under the tree:
 
 Dolls and Stuffed Animals
- Remember when dolls that were pretty were for children, not collectors? A revival is Baby So Beautiful (Playmates Toys, about $ 20), an affordable baby doll with delicate features and carefully detailed clothing. The maker offers the doll in a variety of models with different ethnic features, eye colors, hair colors, and clothes. Included with each doll are a locket and photo album.
- American Girl (Pleasant Company, $ 82 with a paperback story book) is a line of attractive costumed dolls that explores different backgrounds and history. Featured models are Felicity, a colonial girl from 18th century Williamsburg; Kirsten, a Scandinavian immigrant from the 19th century; Addy, a black child whose family escaped slavery in the Civil War period; Samantha, a privileged girl growing up in Victorian times; and Molly, a patriotic youngster from the World War II era. The collection also features a selection of today's children, with a choice of 20 different skin colors, facial features and hair colors. These toys have a variety of tie-ins: furnishings, clothes, accessories, books, matching clothes for the owners, and a magazine.
- Baby dolls based on the benign-looking Gerber trademark baby, launched last year, come in new versions, including the Gerber Food Time Baby (Toy Biz, $ 19.99), a hard-bodied doll that can be spoon-fed; the Newborn Baby ($ 16.99), a soft-bodied doll which sleeps and sucks her thumb; and the Collector Doll ($ 39.99), a porcelain-like but unbreakable 18-inch doll in special dress. Food Time and Newborn models come in either black or white skin colors; the Collector additionally comes in Hispanic colorings.
- Suzie Stretch (Irwin Toy, $ 35) already has hit it off in Europe and Canada and arrives in the United States this season. Kids slip their toes into Suzie's feet, wrap her arms around their waist, and tumble, twist and stretch with her. The whimsical doll helps children learn balance and fitness skills. Suzie comes in both white and black versions.
- The upmarket plush animal kingdom from Steiff runs from whales, seals, elephants, chimps, camels, ponies to the familiar comforting bear. A 17-inch brown-tipped teddy bear is $ 215, and a four-inch charcoal gray teddy named Coal, peering out from a Christmas stocking, is $ 90.
- Bears bearing period costumes are Bears from the Past by Russ, including Abigail and Emily, 16 -inch brown bears ($ 45 each) in Victorian dresses.
- Mickey and Minnie Mouse endure for franchised generations, as Disney Babies squeezable plush toys ($ 7.99 to $ 8.99) and footed pajamas ($ 7.99) for infants and toddlers. This collection coordinates with other Disney Babies products, such as soft puzzles, activity toys, books, musical mobiles, and clothing.
 
 Building Fun
- Those familiar plastic bricks almost demand creative action. There's a new Lego System FreeStyle Line for boys and girls from three to 12 that lets them build from imagination. The sets have the basic bricks plus some new shapes and pieces; FreeStyles include the new Aquazone Play Theme package with underwater world sets and the Town, Space, Castle, Pirates, Boats and Trains sets. For youngsters ages seven to 14 interested in how things tick, Lego Technic sets come with gears, pulleys, beams and other special pieces; there are sets for big-tire vehicles and a helicopter, among others. And for the youngest builders, six to 24 months, Lego has a new Duplo Baby line - stacking toys with animals that make rattle sounds and oversized blocks with rounded corners. Prices range from $ 1.49 for the Lego System FreeStyle trial size bag to $ 169.99 for the Lego System Monorail Transport Base.
- The classic Erector Set for youngsters eight years to adulthood, revived a few years ago, is still going strong, with basic sets ranging from 203 to 452 parts ($ 19.99 to $ 69.99) and advanced sets with 6-volt motors ranging from 556 to 640 parts ($ 86.99 to $ 114.99). Junior Erector Sets include the Tool Center ($ 29.99) and the Power Hauler with friction motor ($ 49.99).
 
 Toys That Fly and Roll
- Tonka's Sky Patrol Rescue Copter ($ 39.99) responds electronically to a child's commands; he can hear random voice commands and sounds by activating a working winch, spinning the rotor blades, removing or replacing the gurney and pilot figure, and making the copter land or take off.
- The company also has bet the family farm with the Tonka Farm Playset ($ 69.99), which has a barn, working grain elevator, silo with drop chute and opening doors, a pickup truck with a posable figure, four animal figures, eight fence pieces, four pretend bales of hay, and more.
- Emulating the family outing, the Outbounder Motor Home ($ 20) from Nylint has detailed interior, sunroof, and all the things to take along - a canoe, mountain bike, and of course, the family of four.
- Nylint also offers some popular road models in miniature - a Ford Explorer pulling a bathtub-worthy Ocean Runner ($ 20) and Dodge Ram towing the Sea Doo XP ($ 20).
- The Budgie Push-A-Long ($ 8) from Nylint is based on the helicopter character in the children's stories by the Duchess of York; it has a soft molded face, storage door, and eyes that move when the rotor is turned.
- The Shining Time Station is re-created by the train experts from Lionel. A Deluxe Electric Train Set ($ 199.95) includes Thomas the Tank Engine with three interchangeable faces, Annie, Clarabel, Sir Topham Hatt, transformer, playmat and sound system. The company also offers the James & Troublesome Trucks Set ($ 179.95), with three interchangeable faces for James the Red Engine and each of the Troublesome Trucks.

 Wheels
- It's a bike that evokes nostalgia, and it's being re-issued this season. The 1930s-era Schwinn Excelsior "Paper Boy" Cruiser, with balloon tires, motocycle drum brakes, brake levers and handlebars, has been re-created from 1955 specifications discovered by Schwinn Bicycles during a recent move. This forerunner of today's mountain bikes has a big sofa seat, big fenders and whitewalls. Models sell for $ 189 to $ 275.
-Schwinn, celebrating its centennial, also has reconstructed another classic - the 1949 Black Phantom in gleaming chrome with integrated headlight and frame-mounted "horn tank." Only 5,000 of these bikes will be made. Originals of the model are now valued at about $ 4,000.
- Non-traditional but very PC are the Metaloid bikes from Huffy, the first made from recycled aluminum. Designs have futuristic-looking double-cross frames, bar handles and low-profile saddles. The chainguards are not unlike hubcaps on a sportscar. Prices range from $ 149 to $ 199.
 
 Slider
- Sleds are as old as time, but a new twist is the Rubbermaid Sled, made of double-wall, blow-molded materials with a fast runner system, full grip handles and footrest with bumped texturing. Expect to pay about $ 29.99 for the sled, available in purple with neon green or neon pink accents.
 
 Amusements
- For the kid who isn't ready to play hardball, there is the Koosh, by Oddzon. This bizarre but user-friendly creation (essentially a wad of rubber bands with a haircut) is recommended by the National Youth Sports Coaches Association to help children develop motor skills. The original Koosh ($ 5 to $ 6) is available this year in sports-color combinations; there's also a Mini-Koosh ($ 3) - two inches in diameter, about half the size of the standard model.
- The little one doesn't have to be a duffer. The Spalding Deluxe Golf Set ($ 34.99) from JustSports has three basic clubs, putting cup, tee and golf bag, all scaled to junior golfers ages five and older.
- Junior gardeners can dig in with small versions of the parents' tools, made by the same company that makes the full-size models. Ames Eco Masters Kids' Tools have poly construction for children two to six and wood handles and metal heads for those ages seven and up. The poly tools ($ 6 to $ 8) include a 32-inch lawn rake and garden hoe and a 26-inch D-handle round-point shovel. Tools for older children ($ 8 to $ 10) include a 55-inch poly lawn rake with hardwood handle, a 44-inch long-handled round-point shovel, a 42-inch garden rake, and a 44 -inch hoe.
- Young theatricals can put on a show with the Velcro Puppet Playhouse (under $ 35), with interchangeable parts and costumes, scenery and stage, via Velcro fastening materials. Designed by The Periales, directors of the Perry Alley Theatre, the set includes instructions, story lines and guides to producing six famous fairy tales: Beauty and the Beast, Rapunzel, The Princess and the Pea, The Sleeping Beauty, The Frog Prince and Rumpelstiltskin.
- Even three-year-olds must get ready for the commercial world. The Playskool Playstore ($ 39.99) lets kid storeowners ring up purchases on the cash register or with an electronic scanner; pay for them with play money or plastic.
- An old favorite comes along in new dress. Young artists can have fun with Crayola's Glow in the Dark ($ 3.49) 8-pack crayon sets with one "colorless" crayon that can be seen only in the dark. Binney & Smith, the maker, also markets Crystal Putty, a new holographic version of Silly Putty that glitters ($ 2). Stick a few pieces to a window, and in a few hours "icicles" will form.
 
 Special Toys for Special Kids
- Choosing toys for children with special needs will be easier with a catalog published by the Toys "R" Us chain, in association with the National Parent Network on Disabilities and the National Lekotek Center: "Toy Guides for Differently-Abled Kids."
The publication spotlights 116 toys recommended for disabled children, designed to meet their developmental needs. This year's edition features Heather Whitestone, the first Miss America with a disability. Copies are available at the chain's stores.
