If the $ 10 billion merger of Chemical Banking Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp. is completed, the new company would enable the United States to return to the rankings of the world's Top 20 banks for the first time since 1986.
In 1986, New York-based Citicorp ranked ninth, but it fell to 22nd the next year as the yen began rising against the dollar. The American Bankers Association said Monday that no U.S. banking company has returned to the top 20 since.
The Top 20 ranking includes mergers that have been announced but not yet completed. It is based on rankings of assets in terms of the U.S. dollar by The Banker, analysts at CBM Group Inc. and company announcements. The banks name is followed by its assets and the country where it is based. Assets are listed with a decimal point when rounding would make it appear two banking businesses were equal.
