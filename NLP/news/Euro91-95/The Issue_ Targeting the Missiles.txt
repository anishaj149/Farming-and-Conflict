Here are the views of the major presidential candidates on the question: "Russian President Boris Yeltsin says it's time the U.S. and the Soviet Union stop targeting each other with nuclear missiles. As president, how would you target the U.S. missile force?"
 
 DEMOCRATS
-Jerry Brown: Has not taken a public stand on how the missile force should be targeted.
 
 -Bill Clinton: Has not taken a public stand on how the missile force should be targeted.
-Tom Harkin: "This Russian claim that they have stopped targeting nuclear weapons on U.S. cities or bases has no practical significance. Targeting instructions could be changed back to American cities or bases tomorrow, should hardliners regain control of the Russian Republic. As president, I would set a goal of eliminating all tactical nuclear weapons to no more than 1,000 each, but I would not reveal the actual targeting plans."
 
 -Bob Kerrey: "As we develop friendly, cooperative relations with Russia and the other Commonwealth states, we should no longer treat them as enemies. As their nuclear forces shrink and cease to target us, we need to do the same. Ultimately, we should only direct our nuclear forces against what we see as real nuclear threats or major threats to our vital interests."
 
 -Paul Tsongas: "The important issue with respect to our nuclear missiles is not targeting, it is reduction. With the diminishing threat from the former Soviet Union, we must make it a national imperative to negotiate for reduced nuclear arsenals. Our remaining missiles should be targeted on any nation which poses a significant nuclear threat to us."
 
 REPUBLICANS
-George Bush: The Bush administration has said the United States will consider removing the former Soviet Union as the principal target for U.S. nuclear missiles if Yeltsin carries out his pledge to stop targeting U.S. sites.
 
 -Patrick Buchanan: "How our missiles are targeted should remain top secret. In general, offensive weapons should be targeted against any foreign nuclear threat in the absence of nuclear treaties backed by verification procedures. At the same time, the U.S. should deploy the Strategic Defense Initiative to provide us with the best possible missile defense."
 
 -David Duke: "As president, I would first formulate an agreement with President Yeltsin for a complete and total inspection of all nuclear warheads and targeting. An agreement should be reached for a reduction of nuclear warheads on both sides as long as complete inspection and verification is maintained."
