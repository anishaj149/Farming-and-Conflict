WHAT HAPPENED:
The United States, in concert with 16 other countries, swooped into the global foreign exchange market to buy dollars in hopes of stopping the currency's most recent drop in value against the Japanese yen and German mark. The dollar rallied briefly but the effort quickly failed and the currency tumbled again.
WHY?
Traders said this central bank intervention, the third since late April, had been widely expected. Moreover, they said the amount of dollars bought, an estimated $ 5 billion, was trivial compared with the multitrillion-dollar magnitude of the market, where selling of dollars overwhelmed purchases.
 
 MARKET IMPACT:
The dollar closed near its post-World War II low against the Japanese yen and hit a 15-month low against the German mark. The erosion spilled into other financial markets, spooking investors in American stocks and bonds. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 62 points to a six-week low. Falling bond prices pushed the yield on the key 30-year Treasury bond, a barometer of interest rate trends, to 7.52 percent, the highest level since mid-May.
 
 OTHER IMPACT:
Clinton administration critics called the intervention a botched effort and a vote of no-confidence. Economists said the dollar's depreciation increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve, which already has raised interest rates four times this year, would have to raise rates further.
