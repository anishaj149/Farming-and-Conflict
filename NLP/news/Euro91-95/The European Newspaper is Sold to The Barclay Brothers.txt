The European, the English-language weekly founded by Robert Maxwell, has been sold to British investors for an undisclosed price, a court appointed administrator announced Monday.
The sale is the first major disposal of Maxwell property since the court appointed administrators took over in the wake of Robert Maxwell's death at sea on Nov. 5.
Most of Maxwell's media empire is operating under bankruptcy court protection from creditors in the United States and Britain.
Martin Fishman, the court-appointed administrator for the privately owned The European, announced that the newspaper had been sold to a company controlled by David and Frederick Barclay.
The 57-year-old twin brothers have interests in real estate and hotels. The Sunday Times ranks them as Britain's 18th wealthiest family.
Charles Garside, the former deputy editor who took over as acting editor under the administrators, is staying on a editor and general manager, the statement said.
The new owners didn't immediately announce what their plans were for the paper, or how many employees would be rehired.
The European clung to life for weeks while the administrators sought a buyer. Its staff of 150 was laid off in mid-December, but the paper continued to publish with about half that number rehired on a temporary basis.
The newspaper, which Maxwell launched as a pan-European weekly in May 1990, had a circulation of about 250,000. Garside has said it was losing less than $ 376,000 a week.
