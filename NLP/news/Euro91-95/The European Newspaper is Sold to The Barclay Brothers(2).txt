The European, a money-losing weekly newspaper founded by Robert Maxwell, has been sold to British investors for an undisclosed price, a court appointed administrator announced today.
The sale is the first major disposal of Maxwell property following Robert Maxwell's mysterious death at sea on Nov. 5 and the subsequent collapse of his media empire, most of which is under bankruptcy court protection from creditors in the United States and Britain.
Martin Fishman - the court-appointed administrator for The European, which is privately owned - announced that the English-language newspaper had been sold to a company controlled by David and Frederick Barclay.
The 57-year-old twin brothers have interests in real estate and hotels. The Sunday Times ranks them as Britain's 18th wealthiest family.
Charles Garside, the former deputy editor who took over as acting editor under the administrators, is staying on a editor and general manager, the statement said.
The new owners didn't immediately announce what their plans were for the paper, or how many employees would be rehired. It was created by Maxwell in an effort to capitalize on Europe's growing political and economic integration.
The European clung to life for weeks while the administrators sought a buyer. It continued to publish with about half its staff, rehired on a temporary basis after all 150 employees were laid off in mid-December.
The newspaper, which Maxwell launched as a pan-European weekly in May 1990, had a circulation of about 250,000. Garside has said it was losing about 200,000 pounds ($ 376,000) a week.
