The NATO-led force for Bosnia will eventually include more than 75,000 troops from 20 countries - over 60,000 inside Bosnia and an additional 15,000 nearby.
Those in Bosnia are divided into three sectors, each led by one of the main troop contributors, and are charged with patrolling separation lines between the warring parties, which are to be in place by Jan. 19.
A look at the current status:

 THE AMERICAN SECTOR
The United States - the largest contributor to the NATO-led force - plans to send 20,000 troops to Bosnia. About 9,070 have arrived, with the remainder expected from bases in Hungary, Italy and Croatia by mid-February.
Based in the northeastern city of Tuzla, the U.S. contingent includes troops from the 1st and 2nd brigades of the 1st Armored Division.
Joining the Americans will be nearly 5,600 other troops - 1,600 Turks, 872 Swedes, 807 Danes, 450 Finns, 1,050 Norwegians and 700 Poles. About 2,900 have arrived; the rest are due to be in place by mid-February.
About 120 Russian paratroopers arrived in Tuzla on Friday. Another 1,600 are due by Jan. 25.

 THE BRITISH SECTOR
Britain had a head start in the NATO deployment since it already had thousands of troops in Bosnia as U.N. peacekeepers. Almost 11,000 of Britain's planned 13,000 troops should be in place by Jan. 19. They have a base in Sipovo, in Bosnian Croat territory, and a new command headquarters in the northern Serb stronghold of Banja Luka.
Britain's former colony, Pakistan, said last month it would send 3,000 troops to the sector.
About 1,000 Canadians assigned to the area should be fully deployed by the end of the month. The Czech Republic also has promised to send 1,000 troops.
The Netherlands has sent 2,100 troops into the British sector; another 100 are due by the end of this month. Belgium has also committed 400 troops to the sector.
Austria will send 150 logistical support troops - mostly drivers - to the sector by mid-February. Another 150 will head for the French sector.

 THE FRENCH SECTOR
The 7,500 French troops who served as peacekeepers in Bosnia will remain under NATO command.
Based in Sarajevo, the force includes three infantry battalions with 36 tanks, 20 attack helicopters, 16 155-mm guns, an antitank company and an antiaircraft contingent.
Italy has 1,364 soldiers in the French sector and promises to bring that up to 3,200. Portugal will deploy 911 troops in the sector by the end of the month.
Spain has 1,250 troops based in Mostar, scene of Muslim-Croat clashes over the past week, with 503 more to be deployed. Some 300 Greek troops are stationed 20 miles northwest of Sarajevo.
Morocco has committed 1,200 troops, and 635 Egyptian peacekeeping troops in the region since 1993 will also come under the French command, as will 500 Ukrainians. Malaysia has said it will boost its force of 973 to 1,533 by the end of this month.
Last month, Jordan reportedly promised to send a force of 50, and tiny Luxembourg promised 20 troops.

 ELSEWHERE
There are an additional 4,500 French troops outside Bosnia, some based at sea, others at air bases in Italy.
Some 1,200 German troops are in neighboring Croatia as a backup force for the British troops in central Bosnia. Another 500 air force personnel are in Italy, and 270 marines are based in the Adriatic sea. The German force will reach 4,000 by mid-February.
Hungary will station 419 troops in Okucani, central Croatia, by the end of this month. Slovakia was reported last month to have committed 200 troops to Croatia.
Aside from their troops in the American sector, 50 Norwegians are manning three Norwegian Air Force C-130 transport planes in Rimini.
Outside the French sector, Greece has 700 troops serving on warships in the Adriatic Sea or manning NATO C-130s supplying troops in Bosnia from bases in Italy.
A Russian battalion of 3,000 troops and a Belgian battalion of the same are in Croatia to patrol the disputed region of eastern Slavonia. There is also a Czech mobile hospital in Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
In addition, a U.N. peacekeeping force is deployed in Macedonia along the Serbian border. The force includes 700 Scandinavians and 300 Americans.
Other countries promising minor logistical support are Slovenia, Albania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

 CASUALTIES
One soldier has died and 17, including two Americans, have been injured since NATO troops started taking their places last month.
The death was a British soldier who committed suicide at Christmas. Most of the injuries have been in mine explosions, but one Italian soldier was hit by sniper fire.
