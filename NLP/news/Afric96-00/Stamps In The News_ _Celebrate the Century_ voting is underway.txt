The campaign is on! The U.S. Postal Service says "get out and vote."
As part of its "Celebrate the Century" program, the USPS is now conducting a nationwide public voting effort to select stamp designs on subjects that occurred during the 1950s.
Voters are being provided with 30 subjects and can choose three in each of the following categories: People and Events, Arts and Entertainment, Sports, Science and Technology, and Lifestyle. Every post office in the United States has ballots available.
Some of the individual subjects listed on the ballots are: Rock 'n' Roll, "I Love Lucy," The Cold War, U.S. Launches Satellites, Teen Fashions, Computers, World Series Rivals, and Advances in Surgery.
Voting for the decade of the 1960s will begin in May.
The "Celebrate the Century" commemorative stamp program started in early February with the issuance of 30 stamps - one set of 15 honoring the 1900s and the other 15 hailing the 1910s. Stamps for the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s are forthcoming with designs recommended by the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee.
The initial 30 stamps included the first crossword puzzle created in 1913, the transcontinental telephone line completed in 1914, "The Great Train Robbery" motion picture of 1903, and the first World Series played in 1903.
The Postal Service is working in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Education and leading educational associations to reach about 300,000 students across the country to promote the program.
