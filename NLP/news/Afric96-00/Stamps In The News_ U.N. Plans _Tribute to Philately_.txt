A "Tribute to Philately" is the theme of the latest six stamps issued by the United Nations Postal Administration.
Each stamp portrays a stamp within a stamp. The 1986 U.N. stamps, also on the philatelic theme, are reproduced on the new stamps. The 32-cent stamp shows the 22-cent stamp of 1986 while the 50-center features the 44-cent item of that year. The designs are repeated on the two Austrian values and the two Swiss stamps.
The new U.N. stamps, designed by Robert Stein of the United States, were printed in offset lithography in four color process without watermark.
A souvenir card on the theme "Tribute to Philately" also has been issued. The card depicts all six new stamps and carries a statement by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
The new set of stamps is also a tribute to Joseph Arce, who was president of the United Nations General Assembly 50 years ago. Arce was an avid stamp collector and through his efforts the U.N. Postal Administration was created. The first U.N. stamps were issued in 1951.
First-day cancellations and orders for the stamps can be purchased via the United Nations Postal Administration, P.O. Box 5900, Grand Central Station, New York, N.Y. 10163-9992. Or you may phone (800)-234-UNPA.
You can be placed on the UNPA Philatelic Bulletin mailing list or open a Customer Deposit Account by contacting the UNPA at the same address and telephone number.
