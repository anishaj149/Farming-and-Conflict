Major conclusions of the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report:
 
 AFRICA
Although Rwandan military killed hundreds of civilians during 1996, the country as a whole "took a major step toward national reconciliation" with the return of masses of Hutu refugees. In Burundi, serious human rights abuses continued under Tutsi-dominated security forces, such as numerous extrajudicial killings. Elsewhere, the situation in Sudan "remained extremely poor, as both the government and insurgents committed serious human rights abuses."

BALKANS
Serbian authorities committed "extensive and systematic" human rights violations, including murder, torture, rigging of elections. Bosnia and Croatia - two other states of the former Yugoslavia - had "widespread abuses of citizens on an ethnic basis." Some improvements were noted in both nations during the past year, an assessment that was not made for Serbia. Ethnically motivated murders and lootings continued, although "far fewer in number than in 1995."

BURMA
Authorities stepped up systematic repression of human rights despite formally ending the house arrest of the nation's leading pro-democracy activist, Aung San Suu Kyi.
 
 ---
CHINA
The country's security apparatus has silenced all public dissent against the Communist Party and government "by intimidation, exile or the imposition of prison terms, administrative detention or house arrest." The Chinese government "continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses … stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest and the continuing absence of laws protecting basic freedoms."
 
 ---
CUBA
The communist country "remains a totalitarian anachronism, where human rights deteriorated in 1996 and suppression of dissent worsened." Cuba's Interior Ministry "maintains a pervasive system of vigilance through undercover agents, informers, the Rapid Response Brigades and the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution." Human rights conditions worsened with a "large-scale crackdown" against a prodemocracy umbrella group and increased reports of deaths due to the excessive use of force by police.

GERMANY
Businesses whose owners or executives are Scientologists may face government-approved discrimination and boycotts, including expulsion from the government's political party and loss of employment. The document noted that Germany's parliament formed a special commission to investigate the church's activities, and the ruling Christian Democratic Union urged authorities to place it under police surveillance.
 
 ---
MIDDLE EAST
Setbacks in the Middle East peace process and the hunt for terrorists resulted in human rights abuses by both Israeli and Palestinian authorities. Elsewhere, Iraq's government continues to exercise "absolute dictatorial authority." Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria and Libya commit serious human rights abuses. Israeli and Palestinian police and military authorities arrested or detained about 1,000 Palestinians each in the wake of several suicide bombing attacks. Some suspects were tortured, and several died in custody. "Terrorist acts had a deeply chilling effect on both diplomacy and human rights observance. In some countries, such as Egypt ..., campaigns against extremists have resulted in abuses, including torture."
 
 ---
NIGERIA
The military government's human rights performance "remains dismal." The government of Gen. Sani Abacha "regularly relied on arbitrary detention, arrests and wide-scale harassment to silence its many critics." "Security forces committed extrajudicial killings, tortured and beat suspects and detainees; prison conditions remained life-threatening; and security officials continued routinely to harass human rights and democracy activists, labor leaders, environmentalists and journalists."
 
 ---
RUSSIA
On the one hand, free elections were held for a president and a parliament. On the other, prison conditions worsened, and lengthy pretrial detention continued. "Violent hazing of military conscripts sparked new protests. Journalists throughout Russia covering controversial issues were subjected to pressure, physical violence and even death, while the government appeared unresponsive to requests for investigation of these cases. Discrimination against minorities remains a problem, and discrimination against women in some sectors has intensified in recent years." A "genuine bright spot" - the withdrawal of Russian forces from Chechnya, where a conflict claimed tens of thousands of lives.
 
 ---
TURKEY
The country's human rights record was "uneven" and "deteriorated in some respects." Widespread cases were reported of torture by security forces, deaths during detention and other killings in which the assailants remain unknown. It called attention to a "growing recognition in the government, parliament, the media … and the public at large that the country's human rights performance is inadequate and needs to be brought in line."
