Excerpts from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report on human rights abuses committed during the fight against white rule:
---
From Retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu's foreward:
"However painful the experience has been, we remain convinced that there can be no healing without truth. My appeal to South Africans as they read this report is not to use it to attack others, but to add to it, correct it and ultimately to share in the process that will lead to national unity through truth and reconciliation."
---
Report's "primary finding":
"The predominant portion of gross violations of human rights was committed by the former state through its security and law enforcement agencies. Moreover the South African state … from the late 1970s to early 1990s became involved in activities of a criminal nature when … it knowingly planned, undertook, condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful acts, including the extra-judicial killing of political opponents inside and outside South Africa."
---
On former President P.W. Botha:
"Mr. Botha was responsible for ordering former Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok and former police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe unlawfully to destroy Khotso House (which housed anti-apartheid groups)."
---
On the African National Congress:
It "perpetrated gross violations of human rights in that the distinction between civilian and military targets was blurred … resulting in … civilian injury and loss of life."
---
On the media:
English language media "often adopted a policy of appeasement toward the state, ensuring a large measure of self-censorship." The Afrikaans-language media "with rare exceptions chose to provide direct support for apartheid and the activities of the security forces, many of which led directly to gross violations of human rights."
---
On the judiciary:
"The judiciary and the magistracy as well as the … legal profession were locked into an overwhelmingly passive mindset which characterized the judgments of the bench in the face of the injustices of apartheid."
---
On business:
"The business sector failed … to take responsibility for its involvement in state security initiatives … specifically designed to sustain apartheid rule."
---
On religion:
South African Christianity "promoted the ideology of apartheid in a range of different ways that included Biblical and theological teaching." Ethical failures by religious communities "contributed to a climate within which apartheid was able to survive."
---
On accountability:
"Prosecution should be considered where evidence exists that an individual has committed a gross human rights violation" unless they have asked for amnesty.
---
On reconciliation:
"Reconciliation is a process which is never-ending, is costly and often painful. For this process to develop it is imperative that democracy and a human rights culture be consolidated. Reconciliation is centered on the call for a more decent, more caring and more just society."
---
On white attitudes:
"Despite amnesty provisions extending to criminal and civil charges, the white community often seemed either indifferent or plainly hostile to the work of the commission, and certain media appear to have actively sought to sustain this indifference and hostility."
---
On the submission of the Inkatha Freedom Party:
"The Inkatha Freedom Party made no pretense of cooperating with the commission. Its submission to the commission consisted largely of a lengthy exposition of how the president of the IFP had been vilified by his political enemies … its submission was singularly unforthcoming, evasive and defensive."
---
On destruction of state documents:
"The former state deliberately and systematically destroyed state documentation in an attempt to ensure that a new democratic government would be denied access to incriminating evidence."
---
On abuse of women:
"Women were abused by the security forces in ways which specifically exploited their vulnerabilities as women, for example rape or threats of rape and other forms of sexual abuse." On the ANC treatment of women in its military camps: "Women in exile, particularly those in camps, were subjected to various forms of sexual abuse and harassment, including rape."
---
On the state chemical, biological warfare program:
The program's scientists "had as their purpose the murder of individuals and the undermining of the health, if not the elimination, of entire communities."
---
On conscription:
"The state's policy of conscription was immoral and denied conscripts the right to freedom of conscience and the right to refuse to serve in the South African Defense Force. Through the policy of conscription the state and the SADF used young men to assist, implement and defend the policy of apartheid, to maintain the illegal occupation of Namibia and to wage war against neighboring countries."
