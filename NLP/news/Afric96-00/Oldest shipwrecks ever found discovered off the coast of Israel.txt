Using the same techniques he used to locate the Titanic, explorer Bob Ballard said today he has found the oldest known deepwater shipwrecks: a pair of wine-laden ships dragged to the depths of the Mediterranean during a fierce storm more than 2,500 years ago.
The pair of Phoenician cargo ships were found using an underwater robot and deep-water tracking equipment, Ballard told reporters at a Tel Aviv hotel overlooking the Mediterranean.
"A lot of history books will be rewritten from what we are finding in the deep seas," the American said.
The contents of the ships indicate that they set sail from the Phoenician port of Tyre - now a city in Lebanon - about 750 B.C. Both vessels were transporting hundreds of amphorae, large ceramic containers filled with wine. Although the amphorae were found intact, the wine had seeped out and sand had filled them.
The ships were headed either for Carthage - in modern-day Tunisia - or Egypt. The vessels are positioned upright about 1,500 feet deep on the ocean floor, about 30 miles off the shores of Israel. The route was not previously known as one used by Phoenician sailors.
One ship is approximately 60 feet long, the largest pre-classical ship ever discovered, Ballard said. The smaller ship is located about two miles away and is 45 feet long.
The ships are almost perfectly preserved - a result of the cold deep-sea waters and the relative absence of sediment at such depths.
Stone anchors were found, as well as crockery, a wine decanter, and incense stands for offering prayers to the weather gods.
The ships were believed to have been part of a fleet of cargo carriers. They probably went down in a violent storm and each likely carried a crew of six, said Lawrence Stager, an archeologist from Harvard University.
Phoenicians were a seafaring people who lived along the Levantine coast for about 2,000 years beginning in 2300 B.C.
The search was sponsored by the National Geographic Society, the United States Office of Naval Research and an Israeli archaeological institute.

Ancient Ships Discovered
Use information from the story to answer the following true and false questions:
----- 1. More than 2,500 years ago, weather gods destroyed Phoenician vessels traveling to Egypt.
----- 2. American explorer Bob Ballard found two sunken ships on the floor of the Mediterranean.
----- 3. The wrecks were located two miles off the coast of Israel.
----- 4. The pair of Phoenician ships are the world's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks.
----- 5. Ballard reports that the larger vessel is about 25 feet longer than the smaller ship.
----- 6. The shipwrecks were equipped with underwater robots and tracking devices.
----- 7. It was discovered that both cargo ships were carrying amphorae, ceramic jugs filled with wine.
----- 8. No wine was left in the amphorae because the containers cracked when the ships were caught in a violent storm.
----- 9. Other items found aboard the pre-classic vessels were anchors and pottery.
----- 10. Cold, deep ocean water that was free of sediment (dirt) kept the wine-filled ships in almost perfect condition.
----- BONUS: The deep-sea discovery will probably help us to better understand the history of the Phoenician people.
