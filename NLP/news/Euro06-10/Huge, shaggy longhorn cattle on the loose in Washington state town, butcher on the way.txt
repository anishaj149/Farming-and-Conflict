The police are tired. A cattleman is in trouble. Residents are fed up. Who's the man to fix it?
The butcher, of course.
Police have written more than $2,000 worth of tickets to Hiram Wilburn, 85, about marauding longhorn cattle that have escaped his property through a hole in his fence at least 70 times since early December.
The one-ton, shaggy-haired beasts have been blamed for at least three accidents. Residents say the animals eat gardens and lawns and are generally creepy and scary to have around.
"They're huge those horns you don't know if they're going to attack or what they're going to do," said Sharri Matronic, adding that the cows have destroyed a retaining wall in her yard and eaten her azaleas and ivy.
Wilburn, who was at the center of an earlier animal controversy over some of his exotic deer running loose, could not immediately be reached for comment, but one of his friends, Robert Echard, said a butcher is scheduled to visit the 25-acre property soon.
Police Officer Rich Michelsen had a close encounter of his own recently when one of the Scottish Highland longhorns came calling at the police station in this town of 3,100 about 25 miles northeast of Seattle.
After dealing with cattle calls from residents, Michelsen got into his cruiser, turned on the flashing lights and eased the wayward cow home.
"People think it's funny," he said. "It's tiring, is what it is."
