A look at what happened in some stock markets around the world Wednesday:
EUROPE (AP) World markets were in retreat once more on Wednesday as concerns about the state of the global economy dominated sentiment despite a coordinated rate cut by top central banks aimed at shoring up confidence in the world's crisis-stricken financial system. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares rose, then slid back into the red, ending down 238.53, or 5.2 percent, at 4,366.69. France's CAC-40 settled down 235.33 points, or 6.3 percent lower, at 3,496.89, while Germany's DAX fell 313.01 points, or 5.9 percent, to 5,013.62.
WASHINGTON (AP) In a rare coordinated move, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks from around the world slashed interest rates Wednesday to prevent a mushrooming financial crisis from becoming a global economic meltdown. The Fed reduced its key rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent. In Europe, which also has been hard hit by the financial crisis, the Bank of England cut its rate by half a point to 4.5 percent and the European Central Bank sliced its rate by half a point to 3.75 percent. The central banks of China, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland also cut rates. The Bank of Japan said it strongly supported the actions.
REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) Iceland plunged further into financial crisis on Wednesday as it scrapped plans to nationalize a major bank, Glitnir, instead placing it into receivership, and abandoned attempts to put a floor under its falling currency by fixing the exchange rate. Adding to Iceland's woes, the British government said that it planned to sue over lost deposits held by tens of thousands of Britons with Icelandic bank accounts. The global credit crisis has exacted a heavy toll on Iceland.
LONDON (AP) Hard-hit British banking stocks recovered Wednesday after the government announced a 50 billion pound ($88 billion) plan to partly nationalize major banks and promised to guarantee a further 250 billion pounds ($438 billion) of bank loans to shore up the beleaguered sector amid the world financial crisis. But the drastic moves failed to soothe wildly fluctuating markets, and many shares ended the day sharply lower. Prime Minister Gordon Brown billed it as a "radical" plan to stabilize banks so that they could resume normal lending and other operations, rather than trying to buy up bad assets as the United States is doing. At the same time, the Bank of England made at least 200 billion pounds ($350 billion) in short-term loans available to banks to help restore liquidity to the frozen credit market.d f
MOSCOW (AP) Trading on both Russian stock markets was halted on Wednesday after shares plunged within an hour of opening on fears the credit crisis will take a heavy toll on growth. MICEX, where most trading takes place, was shut until Friday after it dropped more than 14 percent to 637.9 points in the first half-hour of trading. The RTS index which has lost more than 69 percent since its May peak has been shut down until further notice. It fell 11.3 percent in the first half-hour, dropping to 761.6 points. Both exchanges have suspended trading on several occasions in recent weeks in a bid to stem steep slides in share prices.
BEIJING (AP) China cut its key interest rate for the second time in less than a month Wednesday as the United States, Canada and Europe slashed their rates in a global effort to revive investor confidence shaken by a credit crisis. China cut the rate on a one-year loan by 0.27 percentage points to 6.93 percent, adding to official efforts to revive slowing economic growth and help struggling exporters. Beijing also will increase the pool of money available for lending by reducing the amount that Chinese banks must hold in reserve, the central bank said. Chinese shares dropped Wednesday, led by declines for financial and telecoms stocks as the global market crisis worsened. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.04 percent, or 65.61 points, to close at 2,092.22. The Shenzhen Composite Index for China's smaller second market declined 2.64 percent to 570.65.
TOKYO (AP) Japan's stock market plummeted 9.4 percent its biggest one-day drop in 21 years Wednesday as investors rushed for the exits on deepening fears over the global financial crisis. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index nose-dived 952.58 points to 9,203.32, a five-year low. That was its third-biggest drop in percentage terms and the largest plunge since October 1987. Toyota's shares fell nearly 12 percent on concerns about its earnings amid a slump in the vital U.S. car market.
MANILA, Philippines (AP) Philippine shares have tumbled for the fourth straight session on mounting concerns over the fallout from the U.S. financial crisis. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index on Wednesday fell 116.45 points, or 4.8 percent, at 2,307.74. It has lost 11.7 percent since last Thursday. All sectors ended in the red.
MUMBAI, India (AP) Indian markets tumbled Wednesday as investors across Asia dumped stocks on fears that a global recession is brewing. The benchmark Sensex sank 366.88 points, or 3.14 percent, to 11,328.36, with consumer goods and information technology companies leading the decline. The market rallied in the afternoon after hitting an interday low of 10,740.76.
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) Australia's stock market plummeted nearly 5 percent Wednesday amid anxiety about the spreading global financial crisis. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX200 closed down 230.6 points, or 4.99 percent, to 4,388.1. The drop wiped out a 1.72 percent gain on Tuesday after the country's central bank cut its key interest rate by 1 percentage point. Australia's financial sector suffered early Wednesday, as the top four banks dropped just over 3 percent each. In New Zealand, the NZX-50 index closed down 55.88 points or 1.9 percent, to 2,948.31, after finishing Tuesday down 1.5 percent at 3,004.19.
HONG KONG (AP) Hong Kong's de facto central bank says it will cut the benchmark interest rate by 1 percentage point to encourage lending amid the global credit crunch. Hong Kong Monetary Authority said Wednesday it will slash the interest rates to 2.5 percent from 3.5 percent starting Thursday. Also in Hong Kong, hundreds of angry investors in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. protested in Hong Kong Wednesday to demand a full refund of their investment backed by the failed U.S. bank. The rally came after the Hong Kong government proposed Monday a plan under which local banks and distributors of Lehman-backed bonds would buy back the products at a value to be decided on.
SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) Investors panicked again Wednesday across Latin America, prompting central banks to sell billions of dollars in reserves to prop up local currencies while stocks dove in a third straight day of extremely volatile trading. Chile's IPSA was leading losses in late afternoon trading, down 4.8 percent to 2,223, and Brazil's Ibovespa closed down 3.9 percent to 38,594 its lowest close since Oct. 9, 2006. Colombia's IGPC index was down 3.2 percent to 8,411 in late afternoon trading, while Argentina's Merval was off 1.8 percent to 1,359. Mexico's IPC index fell 1 percent to 20,679. Brazil's real sank to a new two-year intraday trading low of 2.5 per U.S. dollar but recovered and was in positive territory. Mexico's peso, which had been trading at fewer than 11 to the dollar for much of the year, briefly hit 14 per dollar. Chile's peso fell to its lowest level in four years, topping 600 pesos per dollar.
