Slobodan Milosevic's son Marko arrived in the Netherlands on Tuesday to claim the remains of the late Serb leader.
Milosevic arrived on an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Amsterdam where his father's lawyer, Zdenko Tomanovic, was waiting to meet him and take him to The Hague. The body remained in the Dutch National Forensic Institute in the city where the former Yugoslav president was on trial for war crimes in the Balkans.
Tomanovic was escorted inside the baggage hall, apparently so that the younger Milosevic could leave by another exit and evade reporters waiting in the arrivals lounge.
Also heading to The Hague Tuesday was a team of Russian forensic experts to inspect the results of an autopsy on the former president. The Russian government said it did not trust the conclusions of the examination conducted by Dutch pathologists on Sunday, the day after he was found dead in his prison cell.
The U.N. war crimes tribunal said preliminary results showed Milosevic died of a heart attack.
"It's a great regret that they did not heed our numerous appeals for an examination," said Leo Bokeria, head of Moscow's Bakulev clinic, claiming Milosevic's life could have been saved with proper treatment.
"The point is that a man who had suffered from a complex of illnesses of the heart and vascular system was not examined adequately, and thus naturally he could not be cured," he told AP Television News before leaving Moscow.
