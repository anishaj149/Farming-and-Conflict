A look at what happened in some stock markets around the world Tuesday:
BERLIN Germany's BayernLB bank became the first to seek help from the federal government Tuesday under a massive financial sector rescue plan, with a senior official saying it would seek up to 5.4 billion euros ($7.2 billion) in aid. Germany's rescue plan, worth up to 500 billion euros ($675 billion), was approved by lawmakers Friday. While other banks have stayed on the sidelines, Bavarian state finance minister Erwin Huber, who heads BayernLB's administrative board, indicated over the weekend that it would seek help.
BRUSSELS, Belgium More European banks may fail as government cash injections dry up and the region's economy grinds to a near-halt next year, the International Monetary Fund warned. The IMF said in its economic outlook for Europe that banks are still under severe pressure to reduce their high leverage the amount of debt they carry in proportion to their assets.
MANILA, Philippines Philippine shares advanced as investors lauded the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman's support for a second stimulus package to aid the U.S. economy. The Philippine Stock Exchange index rose 53.86 points, or 2.61 percent, at 2,116.74, after falling 1.7 percent Monday. Gainers outnumbered decliners 63 to 28, with 38 stocks unchanged. Top-traded Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. surged 3.8 percent, while rival Globe Telecom Inc. was up 2.3 percent.
SYDNEY, Australia Australia's share market closed 3.87 percent higher, rebounding with other world markets and partially buoyed by the central bank chief's reassurance that an international financial catastrophe had been avoided. The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index gained 160.2 points to 4,302.5, the second consecutive increase at closing. Local mining stocks led the rise, with global miner BHP Billiton jumping 10.65 percent and rival Rio Tinto soaring 12.17 percent.
SHANGHAI, China Chinese shares dropped modestly as cautious investors awaited details of new policies promised by the government to help counter the economic slowdown. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index opened higher, tracking overnight gains in New York and Europe. It fell back in afternoon trading, losing 0.8 percent, or 15.48 points, to 1,958.53. The smaller Shenzhen Composite Index faded 0.25 percent to 519.13.
HONG KONG Hong Kong stocks dropped almost 2 percent, dragged down by furious selling in Citic Pacific Ltd. after the conglomerate warned of nearly $2 billion in losses from bad currency bets. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index pared its early gains to close down 281.84 points, or 1.84 percent, at 15,041.17. Shares in Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong arm of the Chinese government's main investment company, fell more than 55 percent. The company, which holds property, steel and infrastructure assets, had said that it stood to lose nearly $2 billion after a top executive made unauthorized bets against the U.S. dollar through leveraged foreign currency contracts.
TOKYO Japanese shares closed higher, marking the third consecutive day of gains. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average rose 300.66 points, or 3.34 percent, to close at 9,306.25. It was a strong rebound from last Thursday when the key stock index plummeted more than 11 percent the biggest one-day loss since 1987 as jittery investors fretted over growing recession fears.
MOSCOW Russian stocks rose on the back of rising oil prices, as OPEC said it is poised to cut output to counter flagging demand. The RTS index rose 2.4 percent to 717.18 points, while the MICEX advanced 4.2 percent to 652.51 points.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan Pakistani finance officials, faced with a looming economic meltdown, brought their case to the International Monetary Fund, though Islamabad has said it would only seek money from the agency as a last resort. IMF spokesman Niels Buenemann declined to give any specifics from the talks, which were held in Dubai, but Pakistani officials have said they may have to ask the fund for cash to avoid defaulting on sovereign debt due for repayment next year. Any default would further shatter local and international confidence in the country as it battles soaring violence by al-Qaida and Taliban militants close to the Afghan border.
MUMBAI, India Indian stocks surged 4.5 percent after the nation's central bank unexpectedly cut the key lending rate by a full percentage point, the latest in a series of aggressive steps the government has taken to boost liquidity in the face of a global economic slowdown. The benchmark Sensex rose 460.30 points, or 4.50 percent, to close at 10,683.39.
LONDON The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closing down 52.94 points, or 1.2 percent, at 4,229.73, as Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said Tuesday it is likely that Britain is entering a recession. Germany's DAX shed 50.60 points, or 1.1 percent, at 4,784.41. France's CAC-40 index of leading shares remained in positive territory, buoyed by the French government's decision to inject 10.5 billion euros ($14 billion) into the country's six largest banks by year-end to help counter the effects of the financial crisis. Though off its session peak, the CAC closed 26.89 points higher, or 0.8 percent, at 3,475.40, with banks in demand. BNP Paribas SA was up 6.9 percent, Societe Generale SA 10.2 percent and Credit Agricole SA 11.3 percent.
SAO PAULO, Brazil Latin American stocks were mostly down on renewed concerns of a global slowdown, and investors sent Argentine equities plunging after the president announced a plan to nationalize pensions. In Latin America, the Merval index in Buenos Aires closed down 129 points at 1,047. Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index fell 1 percent to 39,043 and the nation's currency sank against the U.S. dollar. The real dropped to 2.2 per dollar from 2.1 a day earlier even though the central bank again auctioned off an undisclosed amount of dollars from its more than $200 billion in reserves. Mexico's central bank also moved to prevent its currency from dropping, auctioning off $400 million at about 13 pesos to the dollar. Mexico's IPC stock index fell 2.8 percent to 20,203, Colombia's IGBC dropped 0.4 percent at 7,658 and Chile's IPSA slipped 0.2 percent to 2,542.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina Argentine President Cristina Fernandez signed a bill nationalizing nearly $30 billion in private pension funds, triggering the local stock market to plunge 11 percent. Fernandez said the government has to protect retirees as stocks and bonds fall amid the global financial crisis. But her political opponents called it a naked scramble for cash to prop up falling tax revenue.
TORONTO Canada's central bank cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point, saying Canada needs the stimulus to ward off the effects of a United States already in recession and a global economy heading there. The cut to 2.25 percent follows an unscheduled half-point reduction Oct. 8 in co-operation with other major central banks in an effort to ease lending and boost the global economy. The Bank of Canada is the first central bank to make a further cut since that coordinated move.
