Inflation in the 12 nations that use the euro accelerated to 1.9 percent in November compared with a year earlier, the European Union statistics agency said Friday, revising upward an earlier estimate.
Inflation had slowed to 1.6 percent in October after hitting a high of 2.5 percent in May and June largely on the back of soaring energy costs but also because of Europe's accelerating economy after years of little growth.
Eurostat said natural gas prices were the main factor pushing up rates, followed by vegetables, whose prices rose sharply after bad summer weather ruined some crops.
Transport fuel and telecom prices fell the most compared to a year ago, it said. However, this is not a sign of lower gas pump prices, merely the result of an oil price spike last autumn.
Inflation is at the European Central Bank's recommended guideline of just under 2 percent. The bank closely watches the rate before it decides to raise interest rates. It hiked its headline rate to 3.5 percent earlier this month but refused to rule out more increases in the future after a series of slow increases over the year.
The inflation rate for the entire EU was 2.1 percent in November, rising from 1.8 percent in October.
Within the euro-zone, Finland had the lowest annual inflation rate at 1.3 percent, followed by the region's largest economy Germany at 1.5 percent. Greece reported the highest rate of 3.2 percent with Spain at 2.7 percent.
Eastern European euro-candidates are still experiencing high prices, with Hungary reporting inflation of 6.4 percent compared to the same month last year, while Latvia was at 6.3 percent, Estonia at 4.7 percent and Lithuania at 4.4 percent.
