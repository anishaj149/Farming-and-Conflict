A look at economic developments and stock-market activity around the world Monday:
BEIJING China is considering new steps to boost cooling growth, its top economic official said in comments published Monday in The Financial Times, as new data showed manufacturing shrinking further despite surging government spending. The report gave no details of possible new steps. The government is rolling out a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) package unveiled in November in hopes of shielding China from the global slowdown through heavy spending on public works projects. But the latest data suggest China faces more pain, including a government report that some 26 million migrant workers have lost their jobs due to the global crisis. But Chinese shares rose as government promises of more farm aid boosted agriculture stocks. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.1 percent, or 21.03 points, to close at 2011.68. The Shenzhen Composite Index for China's second exchange climbed 2.1 percent to 623.01.
TOKYO Auto sales in Japan sank to a 37-year low in January as worried consumers held off on big buys, an industry group said. Some 174,281 vehicles were sold for the month, a plunge of 27.9 percent from a year earlier and the biggest fall on record for January sales, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. Records have been kept since 1968. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average lost 120.07 points, or 1.5 percent, to 7,873.98. The broader Topix index fell 2.0 percent to 777.85. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 416.72 points, or 3.1 percent, to 12,861.49. Markets in Singapore, Thailand and India fell 2 percent or more.
LYON, France French Prime Minister Francois Fillon unveiled a plan to invest €4 billion in housing, transport and higher education as part of the government's wider €26 billion ($33 billion) economic stimulus package. In a speech following a meeting with other ministers, Fillon said the government would respond to the global economic crisis by undertaking within the next two years projects that had been scheduled for the following five to ten years. The CAC 40 index shed 1.5 percent to end at 2,930.05.
LONDON After Asian markets closed mostly lower, there was little appetite to buy in Europe as faith in a rapid turnaround in the global economy and corporate earnings faded. Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 ended down 1.5 percent at 4,077.78, while the German DAX dropped 1.5 percent at 4,271.04.
STOCKHOLM Swedish air compressor maker Atlas Copco AB said it would cut 3,000 jobs worldwide as it faces declining demand because of the global financial crisis. The Stockholm-based company says the cutbacks will cost around 400 million kronor ($48 million) to execute and are expected to generate savings of around 2 billion kronor annually.
CANBERRA, Australia Sinking tax revenue from the global slowdown will blow a 115 billion Australian dollar ($73 billion) hole in the Australian government's budget and send it into deficit for the first time in almost a decade, the prime minister said. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd foreshadowed another huge economic stimulus package to be outlined within days, as the government announced an expected plunge in tax receipts during the next four years. Even that would probably not be enough to stave off rising unemployment, he warned. Australia's main index fell 1.2 percent.
SEOUL, South Korea South Korean exports tumbled a record 32.8 percent in January as shipments of everything from automobiles to wireless communication equipment fell, a government report said. The drop in exports to $21.7 billion was the steepest since South Korea began collecting and announcing monthly tallies of exports and imports in 1980, said Nam Kyung-tak, an official at the Ministry of Knowledge Economy. The benchmark Kospi stock index fell 1.3 percent at 1,146.95.
TAIPEI, Taiwan Taiwan's government unveiled a 320 billion New Taiwan dollar ($9.5 billion) plan to create thousands of jobs amid waves of layoffs and company closures caused by the global economic slowdown. The plan is expected to help create at least 150,000 jobs in 2009 and cut the unemployment rate by 0.5 percentage points to 4.5 percent, government spokesman Su Jun-bin said, following an emergency Cabinet meeting Sunday night.
MOSCOW The Russian ruble dropped to new lows, threatening to test the level at which the Central Bank has pledged to defend it. The ruble plunged to 40.60 against a dollar-euro basket a whisker away from the bank's outer limit on the Russian currency. The Central Bank announced Jan. 22 that it would allow the ruble to drop sharply to 41 against the basket, implying almost a 10 percent devaluation and signaling the end to an unsettled period of gradual devaluations, but the currency did not drop sharply right away.
WELLINGTON, New Zealand New Zealand will remain in recession until at least March as business confidence languishes at a historic low and layoffs mount, the government said.
ALMATY, Kazakhstan Kazakhstan is on the verge of nationalizing two major lenders as the banking crisis in Central Asia's largest economy continues to worsen, government officials said.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates Moody's Investors Service said it may cut its ratings for six of Dubai's most prominent state-backed companies and renewed questions about the scope of the government's finances. The six companies under review include global port operator DP World and Emaar Properties, the property developer building the nearly complete world's tallest building in the heart of the city.
BRASILIA, Brazil Brazil reported its first monthly trade deficit since 2001 as the global economic crisis slashes exports. The government said January's exports fell 26 percent from the same month a year ago to $9.8 billion, while imports fell 17 percent to $10.3 billion. The $518 million trade gap was nearly double its most recent trade deficit in March 2001. The Ibovespa index was about flat, down 0.4 percent at 39,284 at midday even as Brazil's largest private sector bank reported an 18 percent drop in fourth quarter profit because of dwindling loan activity caused by the meltdown.
