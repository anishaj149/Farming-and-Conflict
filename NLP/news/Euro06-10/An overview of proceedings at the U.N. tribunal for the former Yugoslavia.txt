A look at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which was established in May 1993 by the U.N. Security Council and was trying Slobodan Milosevic.
JURISDICTION: Perpetrators of atrocities committed during the Balkan wars of the 1990s, including grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war, genocide and crimes against humanity.
ACHIEVEMENTS: More than 160 ethnic Serbs, Croats and Muslims indicted over past 11 years, mostly ethnic Serbs. Milosevic went on trial in February 2002, defending himself against 66 counts of crimes, including genocide, in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
COMPLETED CASES: 40 suspects were found guilty, six not guilty and four were transferred to Balkan states for trial. Indictments were dropped against 25 suspects.
CONVICTIONS: Former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, serving an 11-year sentence, and Gen. Radislav Krstic, serving a 35-year prison term, for aiding and abetting genocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia, in 1995. Goran Jelisic, who called himself the "Serb Adolf," is serving 40 years. The only life sentence was issued against Milomir Stakic, who is appealing.
AT LARGE: Six indictees, including former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, accused of genocide for the Srebrenica massacre.
