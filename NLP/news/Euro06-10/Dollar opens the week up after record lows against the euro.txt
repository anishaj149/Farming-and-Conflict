The dollar rose against the euro Monday, gaining some of the ground lost last week when the U.S currency set record lows.
The euro bought $1.4604 in morning European trading, down from $1.4673 in New York late Friday and more than a cent short of its all-time record $1.4752, reached earlier in Friday's session.
The British pound, which has been trading at its highest levels against the dollar since the early 1980s, sank to $2.0815 from $2.0909.
Paul Jackson, a senior forex dealer at CMC Markets, said there had been "some profit taking" on the euro after its latest highs.
He added that the dollar is "regaining some significant ground against the pound as sliding business confidence seems set to pave the way for a rate cut at the Bank of England."
The dollar has been suffering from speculation that the Fed, which recently has cut rates twice, may keep doing so even as its major European counterparts hold rates steady.
Although lower interest rates can jump-start an economy, they can also weaken a currency as investors transfer funds to countries where they can earn higher returns.
The dollar weakened late last week after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said economic growth would slow noticeably in the U.S. in the coming months while rising oil costs would increase inflation pressures.
The U.S. currency was lower against the Japanese yen on Monday, dropping as far as 109.86 yen its first time below 110 yen for a year and a half before recovering to 110.47 yen in European trading.
