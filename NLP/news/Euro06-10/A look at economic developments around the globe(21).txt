A look at economic developments and stock market activity around the world Friday:
FRANKFURT Germany's inflation rate eased to its lowest level in 10 years in March, mainly due to slumping fuel costs, while import prices in January fell by the most in a decade, the Federal Statistical Office said. The Wiesbaden-based office said that preliminary data from six German states indicate consumer prices rose only 0.5 percent in March from a year earlier, the lowest rate of inflation since July 1999. In a separate report, the office said January import prices fell 5.4 percent from the same month a year earlier, the sharpest decline since February 1999, also due largely to cheaper fuel prices. The index of export prices, meanwhile, decreased 0.9 percent over the year.
LONDON The British economy contracted by more than previously estimated in the last three months of 2008 as households looked to pay down their soaring debt levels, official figures showed. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product in the October-December period declined by 1.6 percent in the October-December quarter from the previous three-month period, more than the 1.5 percent previously estimated by the statistics office. The quarterly decline was the biggest since the second quarter of 1980, when output slumped by 1.8 percent.
LONDON European stock markets extended their losses after Wall Street opened sharply lower as investors cashed in on recent gains. However, reports that British bank Barclays PLC may not have to resort to government insurance on potential losses gave the banking sector a boost. Germany's DAX was down 80.41 points, or 1.9 percent, at 4,178.96, while France's CAC-40 was 47.92 points lower, or 1.7 percent, at 2,844.15. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares fell less than other markets losing 33.96 points, or 0.9 percent, to 3,891.24.
HANOI, Vietnam Vietnam's economic growth slowed to its lowest rate in a decade in the first quarter, the government said, as the global economic slump dragged on exports and construction. Gross domestic product grew an estimated 3.1 percent in the January-March period from a year earlier, less than half of the 7.4 percent growth in the same period last year, the General Statistic Office said in a statement.
SEOUL, South Korea South Korea's economy grew less in 2008 than first reported, the central bank said, as the country fights its worst economic downturn since the Asian financial crisis over a decade ago. The economy grew a revised 2.2 percent last year, compared with the preliminary 2.5 percent announced in January, according to the Bank of Korea. Overall economic growth in 2008 was hit hard by the onset of the global financial crisis and ensuing slowdown. South Korea's economy grew 5.1 percent in 2007.
TOKYO Retail sales in Japan retreated by the biggest margin in seven years in February, the government said, as growing concerns about jobs and wages deepened the country's shopping slump. Consumer prices, meanwhile, were steady. Retail sales fell 5.8 percent from a year earlier to 9.98 billion yen ($101 million) the sharpest decline since February 2002, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The figure marks the sixth straight month that sales have fallen at retail outlets like department stores and supermarkets.
TOKYO Japanese stocks reversed early gains, ending an otherwise stellar week on a slightly lower note. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 9.36 points, or 0.1 percent, to 8,626.97. But the index gained 8.6 percent over the past five sessions its biggest one-week gain since October. The broader Topix index declined 0.3 percent to 824.53 but advanced 7.8 percent during the week, powered by optimism over various government measures to revive the U.S. economy.
BEIJING Profits at China's oil producers, steel makers and other major industrial companies fell sharply in January and February as sales were battered by the global economic crisis, data showed. The data highlighted the impact of China's downturn on even its biggest companies despite a multibillion-dollar government stimulus plan. Hardest-hit were producers of aluminum and other nonferrous metals, which suffered a net loss of 1.9 billion yuan ($279 million), the National Bureau of Statistics said.
SHANGHAI Chinese shares rose for a second day, helped by overnight Wall Street gains, bringing the benchmark's weekly gain to 4.1 percent. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index edged up 12.73 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 2374.44. The Shenzhen Composite Index for China's smaller second exchange added 0.6 percent to 778.54. The rise came despite a government report that total profits at China's biggest oil producers, manufacturers and other companies fell 37 percent in January and February due to the country's economic slump.
WELLINGTON, New Zealand New Zealand's economy contracted at its sharpest rate in 17 years in the fourth quarter amid falling consumption, manufacturing and home-building, the government said. Gross domestic product shrank 0.9 percent from a year earlier the biggest quarterly decline since 1992. The latest data from government body Statistics New Zealand confirmed the economy contracted each quarter of 2008 as the world financial crisis bit deeper.
