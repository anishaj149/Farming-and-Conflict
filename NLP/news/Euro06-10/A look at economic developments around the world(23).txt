A look at economic developments and stock-market activity around the world Friday:
FRANKFURT, Germany A gauge of manufacturing activity contracted for the seventh month running in December for the countries using the euro, falling at the sharpest rate in the 11-year history of the closely watched survey. The monthly purchasing managers' index was revised down to 33.9 in December from the initial estimate of 34.5, down from 35.6 in November. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. The figures reinforced expectations that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates again this month. Germany's DAX rose 162.87, or 3.4 percent, to close at 4,973.07. France's CAC-40 gained 131.72 points, or 4.1 percent, to 3,349.69.
LONDON House prices in Britain fell 16.2 percent in 2008, their fastest rate since records began in 1983, according to Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender. House prices fell 2.2 percent in December from November the eleventh consecutive monthly decline. The bank does not think things will improve in the coming months. Meanwhile, the Bank of England reported that lending by banks to households and businesses tightened significantly during the last three months of 2008 despite massive interest rate cuts from the central bank. The central bank also said mortgage approvals fell 13 percent to 27,000 in November, the lowest level since the series began in 1999. Elsewhere, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply reported that Britain's manufacturing sector, which accounts for around 15 percent of the total economy, suffered its second worst month since 1992 in December. The monthly purchasing managers index recovered slightly from November's low of 34.5 to 34.9 in December. The news adds pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates next week. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed up 127.62 points, or 2.9 percent, to 4,561.79.
MINSK, Belarus Belarus' central bank devalued the Belarusian ruble, allowing the currency to plunge 20 percent to help stop the hemorrhaging of its reserves. The National Bank said the devaluation was aimed at raising the competitiveness of the Belarusian economy, which has been battered by the global financial crisis. It also was a condition of a $2.5 billion loan from the IMF announced Wednesday. But it came as an unwelcome shock to ordinary citizens. The devaluation will make imported goods more expensive and will likely drive up inflation. The government has already announced a 20 percent hike in electricity, heating and other municipal bills.
SINGAPORE Singapore's economy contracted for a third consecutive quarter as a global slump hurt demand for the city-state's exports, prompting the government to lower its 2009 growth forecast and foreshadowing a deeper downturn for the region. Gross domestic product shrank a seasonally adjusted 12.5 percent in the October-December quarter from the July-September quarter and 2.6 percent from a year earlier. But the benchmark stock market index rose 3.9 percent to 1,829.71.
SEOUL, South Korea President Lee Myung-bak said he will make it his priority in the new year to pull South Korea out of the global economic crisis as Asia's fourth-largest economy reported a trade deficit for 2008 its first in a decade. Exports fell 17.4 percent in December from a year ago, the second straight decline after November's 18.3 percent fall. The trade balance for 2008 also swung to a deficit of $13 billion, the first deficit since 1997. In a nationally televised New Year's address, Lee said the government is going into "emergency" mode to cope with the slumping economy, and urged the nation join his efforts. But South Korea's Kospi stock market index added 2.9 percent to 1,157.40.
HONG KONG The Hang Seng index vaulted 655.33 points, or 4.6 percent, to 15,042.81, led by Chinese telecom companies after the central government approved licenses for next generation mobile phone services. Many major markets were closed in Asia, including those in Japan and mainland China.
NEW DELHI The Indian government announced plans to lower key interest rates by one percentage point and boost spending in an effort to stimulate the economy in the face of global economic turmoil. It was the second stimulus package announced in the past month. The government said it hoped the economy could grow by 7 percent this year. Mumbai's Sensex traded 0.6 percent higher to 9,958.22.
VIENNA, Austria The Austrian government appointed a supervisor to oversee Medici Bank, which is reeling from more than $3 billion in losses blamed on Wall Street money manager Bernard Madoff. Austria's Financial Markets Authority said it named Gerhard Altenberger to the post. He will oversee all bank operations to ensure the stricken private lender "carefully adheres to all legal and contractual obligations," the agency said in a statement. Medici CEO Peter Scheithauer and Werner Tripolt, who oversaw the bank's executive committee, both resigned.
