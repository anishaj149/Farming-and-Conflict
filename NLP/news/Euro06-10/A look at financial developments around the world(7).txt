A look at what happened in some stock markets around the world Friday:
LONDON Iceland reached tentative agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a $2 billion loan over two years, an aid package that comes after the country's banking system collapsed amid the global credit crunch. The government said the deal, which still must be approved by the IMF's board in Washington, will also give Iceland immediate access to $830 million to head off the financial threat to the entire economy.
LONDON The British pound tumbled against the dollar, weighed down by dismal economic data, while the euro also dived on worries about Europe's exposure to emerging markets, particularly its crisis-stricken eastern neighbors. The euro fell as low as $1.2494 against the dollar in London, a decline of 3 percent on the day and its lowest level since October 2006. Meanwhile, the pound slumped an astonishing 8 U.S. cents to $1.5260 at one point Friday, after official figures showed the British economy contracted 0.5 percent in the third quarter of the year, far worse than had been expected.
LONDON Britain's economy shrank in the third quarter as the global credit squeeze took its toll, confirming that the country is on the brink of its first recession since 1991. The pound plunged. The contraction in growth in the July to September quarter had been widely expected but the 0.5 percent dip was greater than anticipated, sending share prices and the British pound spiraling downward.
FRANKFURT, Germany Germany's DAX index slid as much as 10 percent at one point Friday, its lowest level since October 1989, although it recovered somewhat to close down 5 percent. In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading British stocks was as low as 8 percent before finishing down 5 percent, while France's CAC 40 was off 3.5 percent. And that won't be the end of it. The European Union said its monthly purchasing manager's index slid to 44.6 in October, its lowest since the benchmark was created in 1998, and indicating recession. It was down from 46.9 in September.
MOSCOW Both Russian stock exchanges fell dramatically, with blue chips Sberbank and Gazprom down heavily. The exchanges shut down early and won't resume trading until Tuesday. The MICEX plunged 14.2 percent to 513.6 points in early afternoon, when financial regulators suspended trading for a second time. The other exchange, the RTS, dropped 13.7 percent to 549.4 points and was shut down about an hour early. Falling stock prices hit a wide range of Russian companies.
WASINGTON The International Monetary Fund is revising its loan programs to make them better suited to members facing financial difficulties, but no decision has been made on what form an emergency loan program would take. Among the ideas under discussion is to provide a credit line in hard currency to countries that otherwise would have no access to foreign capital. The IMF's 24-member executive board is expected to meet next week to examine the various proposals under consideration.
HONG KONG Hong Kong's stock market plunged more than 8 percent, battered by fears of a global recession and weak corporate earnings. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index nose-dived 1,142.11 points, or 8.3 percent, to 12,618.38 the lowest close in almost four years. In financials, HSBC plunged 12.5 percent to 88 Hong Kong dollars, major lender Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd, or ICBC, dropped 7.4 percent to 3.15 Hong Kong dollars, and China Construction Bank lost 8.5 percent to 2.9 Hong Kong dollars.
SEOUL, South Korea South Korea's benchmark stock index dropped, closing below 1,000 points for the first time in more than three years and finishing its worst week on record. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index plummeted 110.96 points, or 10.6 percent, to finish at 938.75, its lowest close since May 2005. The drop pushed the index to its worst weekly fall 20.5 percent since records began to be kept in 1987, according to the stock exchange. The Kospi has now fallen 50.5 percent so far this year, a sharp reversal of the bull market in Korean stocks.
SHANGHAI, China Chinese shares hit a 2-year low, led by real estate developers and financial stocks. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.9 percent, or 35.94 points, to close at 1839.62. The smaller Shenzhen Composite Index slipped 1.7 percent to 505.82.
TOKYO Japan got the biggest blow yet from the unfolding global financial crisis when the yen surged to a 13-year high Friday darkening earnings prospects for nation's big exporters and threatening to drag the world's No. 2 economy into a recession. The dollar sank as low as 90.89 yen on Friday, the lowest since August 1995, amid worries about the U.S. slowdown. News that Sony slashed its earnings forecast the day before only added to investors' alarm, helping send the Nikkei benchmark stock index plunging 9.6 percent to 7,649.08, the lowest since May 2003.
SAO PAULO, Brazil Latin American stocks plunged for a fourth straight day Friday on fears that a global recession will slash demand for the region's commodity exports and continue punishing its largest currencies. Brazil's Ibovespa index slumped 6.9 percent to close at 31,482; Mexico's benchmark IPC index fell 4.6 percent to 16,979 as investors bet that currency losses would continue to plague corporate earnings; Argentina's Merval index meanwhile dropped 7.6 percent to 890.3, losing about 24 percent of its value this week on continued fears that a government plan to nationalize private pensions will drain companies' access to private capital; and Chile's IPSA slipped 2.2 percent to 2,343, while Colombia's IGBC index fell 5.6 percent to 6,671.
UNITED NATIONS U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for "drastic" measures to shore up banks and extend lines of credit to the world's poorest states, pledging to support European and American efforts to rethink the global financial architecture. He said the era of self-regulation among the biggest banks and other money-lending institutions had ended. Ban spoke at a closed meeting with top U.N. agency heads, economic advisers and the heads of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund focusing primarily on the global financial crisis.
