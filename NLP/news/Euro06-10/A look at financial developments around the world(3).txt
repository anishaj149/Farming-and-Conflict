A look at what happened in some stock markets around the world Thursday:
LONDON Norway and Iceland began talks on a potential bailout package for the island nation, whose economy is threatened by the collapse of its financial sector. Iceland, which has also been in talks with the International Monetary Fund to receive funds, sought these emergency measures after its banking system collapsed this month under the weight of the global credit crunch threatening the entire economy. It also suggested that Japan and other Nordic nations could offer support.
HONG KONG Hong Kong's stock market fell more than 3 percent on worries over downbeat company forecasts. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index dropped 506.11 points, or 3.6 percent, to close below the key 14,000 level at 13,760.49. The benchmark lost more than 6 percent earlier. Shares in Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong arm of a key Chinese government investment company, rose more than 1.8 percent after two days of furious selling that wiped out more than half the company's capitalization.
LONDON European stock markets traded mostly higher. Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed 46.94 points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 4,087.83, helped by gains in heavyweight oil stocks BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell after oil prices recovered $2.25 to $69 a barrel.
France's CAC-40 ended 12.69 points, or 0.4 percent, higher at 3,310.87, but Germany's DAX was down 51.37 points, or 1.1 percent, at 4,519.70, dragged down by automaker Daimler AG, which issued another profit warning.
TOKYO Japanese shares retreated for a second session but ended on a hopeful note after a late rally lifted the benchmark index from a five-year low. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average shed 213.71 points, or 2.46 percent, to 8,460.98. At one point, the index had fallen by as much as 7.6 percent to a five-year low. The broader Topix index closed down 1.97 percent at 871.70 after falling 6.5 percent in the morning.
SHANGHAI, China Chinese shares were mixed as real estate developers surged after the government announced new policies aimed at reviving the ailing housing market. But losses across Asia overshadowed those gains. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index hit a close-to two-year low, falling 1.07 percent, or 20.26 points, to 1,875.56. The smaller Shenzhen Composite Index rallied in the afternoon to gain 0.76 percent to 514.56.
SEOUL, South Korea South Korea's benchmark stock index tumbled nearly 7.5 percent to its lowest level in more than three years. The Korea Composite Stock price Index fell 84.88 points, or 7.5 percent, to close at 1,049.71. Earlier, the Kospi plunged as much as 9.4 percent.
MANILA, Philippines Philippine shares sank, tracking steep falls across Asia. The Philippine Stock Exchange index lost 97.09 points, or 4.64 percent, at 1,995.92, extending Wednesday's 1.1 percent drop. Decliners outnumbered gainers 117 to three, with 13 stocks unchanged. All sectors ended in the red.
TAIPEI, Taiwan The weighted price index of the Taiwan Stock market fell 132.08 points, or 2.72 percent, to close at 4,730.51, led by the paper and food sectors. Paper shares lost 3.4 percent, and the food sector fell 3.3 percent.
SYDNEY, Australia Australia's stock market plunged. The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index closed down 4.37 percent at 3,974 points and the broader All Ordinaries was down 4.39 percent to 3,939 points. It was the second straight day that the key index had fallen more than 3 percent in Australia as investor sentiment turned negative despite government efforts in Australia and worldwide to talk up markets and prevent a global recession.
MOSCOW Russia's battered stock market posted fresh losses. The MICEX, where most of Russia's trading takes places, dropped 2.1 percent within 30 minutes of the opening bell; the RTS inched down 0.2 percent. Oil majors Lukoil and Transneft declined 4.3 and 3.8 percent, respectively. State-controlled gas giant Gazprom dropped 3.6 percent.
MEXICO CITY Mexico's central bank sold more than $1 billion in foreign reserves among the largest on record as its troubled currency again slipped to a new record below 14 pesos to the U.S. dollar. Mexico's IPC index fell 1.3 percent to 18,560 as the tumbling peso worsened currency derivatives losses for Mexican companies.
SAO PAULO, Brazil Brazil eliminated a financial transaction tax on foreign investment and announced the central bank will sell up to $50 billion in dollar swap futures contracts to stem the decline of the nation's currency. The tax change decree approved by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva gets rid of government levies on some Brazil investments from foreign investors. Brazil's Ibovespa index fell 3.6 percent amid volatile trading to close at 33,819, following a 10.2 percent drop Wednesday.
BUDAPEST, Hungary Hungary's currency continues to be battered by the global financial crisis even though markets are closed for four days for a national holiday. Over the past few weeks the forint has lost 25 to 40 percent of its value against the euro and the U.S. dollar and the Budapest Stock Exchange's benchmark BUX reached its lowest point in four years. The government has turned for help to the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, and the central bank raised its key interest rate by 3 percentage points on Wednesday to 11.5 percent in an effort to defend the Hungarian currency.
BEIJING The global financial meltdown is injecting a sense of urgency into a summit of European and Asian leaders that gets under way in China's capital on Friday. EU Commission President Jose Barroso set the tone early, saying "unprecedented levels of global coordination" were needed to deal with the crisis.
KIEV, Ukraine The Ukrainian currency plunged against the dollar as people raced to exchange booths to convert their savings into U.S currency. The national currency, the hryvna, plummeted to 5.8818 hryvna per U.S dollar amid a run on banks and soaring demand for foreign exchange. Nervous customers lined up to buy the currency at exchange offices across the capital Thursday, some of which ran out of cash.
