The dollar fell slightly against the euro Monday, with traders looking to interest rate decisions in Frankfurt and London.
In Japan, the yen reached a four-and-a-half year low after Chinese markets closed down 8.3 percent, which raised fears about risk aversion in currency trading.
The 13-nation currency bought $1.3447 in morning trading compared with $1.3443 in New York late Friday, hovering around two-month lows after a better-than-expected jobless figure in the U.S. on Friday reduced expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve Bank.
The Fed has left its rates unchanged over recent months, even as the European Central Bank has raised the cost of borrowing seven times since December 2005. Analysts expect the bank to raise the rate to 4 percent when it meets Thursday.
Higher interest rates, used to combat inflation, can bolster a currency by making the investments denominated in it more attractive.
The British pound rose to $1.9835 from $1.9821 with sentiment gaining that the Bank of England would keep its rate unchanged from 5.25 percent when it meets Thursday.
"The market may be confident that we'll see a quarter point from Frankfurt, but the subsequent press conference should prove insightful with the usual measured comments ... likely to provide further direction as a result," said David Jones, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. "London, however, is expected to leave rates on hold."
In Japan, the dollar fell to 122 Japanese yen from 122.06 late Friday after China's main stock index plunged 8.3 percent, its biggest one-day drop since a February drop that triggered a global market sell-off.
The Shanghai Composite Index fell to 3,670.40, after a 2.7 percent decline Friday. The Shenzhen Composite Index for China's smaller second market fell 7.9 percent to 1,039.90.
