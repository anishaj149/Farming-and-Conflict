The dollar fell slightly against the yen Thursday in Asia as gloomy prospects for the U.S. economy weighed on the currency.
The dollar bought 106.55 yen midafternoon, down from 106.58 yen late Wednesday in New York. The euro fell to US$1.4610 from US$1.4628.
Data on U.S. jobless claims expected later in the day could underscore worries about the U.S. economy, traders said.
Meanwhile, the euro fell slightly on selling ahead of the European Central Bank's rate policy meeting later in the day.
Tokyo traders say the direction of Europe Union's single currency will likely hinge on remarks from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet. Many expect the central bank to stand pat this month.
"The euro has been weak recently amid growing uncertainties about the euro-zone economy," said Hideaki Inoue, chief foreign exchange trader at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking.
Against other currencies, the dollar rose to 40.750 Philippine pesos from 40.250 the previous session, while it fell to 39.475 Indian rupees from 39.50.
Some currencies weren't traded Thursday as markets were closed in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam for the Lunar New Year holiday.
