A look at economic developments and stock market activity around the world Thursday:
LONDON Mortgage lending in Britain was down 44 percent in October compared with a year ago, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said. Meanwhile, government statistics showed that British retail sales fell only 0.1 percent in October from September, and were up 1.9 percent from a year ago, even as major retailers such as Woolworths PLC and Marks & Spencer PLC struggle. On the labor front, pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca PLC said it plans to close three plants in Spain, Belgium and Sweden and cut 1,400 jobs in Europe by 2013, while expanding in Asia, while aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC said it plans to cut up to 2,000 jobs next year. In financial news, the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC's shares soared on expectations stockholders will vote in favor of a proposed 20 billion pound ($30 billion) investment from the government, which would shore up the beleaguered bank's balance sheet. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed down 130.69 points, or 3.3 percent, at 3,874.99.
ZURICH, Switzerland The Swiss National Bank cut its key interest rate in half to 1 percent, its second reduction this month. Before this month, the Swiss bank had reduced its rates only once in the last 5 1/2 years. The benchmark Swiss index fell 4 percent to settle at 5,306.10.
TOKYO Japanese exports fell 7.7 percent in October, their biggest decline in seven years. It is the country's second trade deficit in three months. Trade deficits are a rarity for Japan, the world's second-largest economy and a major exporter of electronics and autos. Truck maker Isuzu Motors Ltd. said it will cut 1,400 contract workers as it scales back production. Domestic rivals Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. also have announced production cuts. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 average slid 570.18 points, or 6.9 percent, to 7,703.04.
HELSINKI, Finland Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark and the International Monetary Fund pledged a combined $4.6 billion (3.64 billion euros) in loans to help Iceland recover from its economic meltdown. The Nordic countries said they would lend the cash-strapped Atlantic island nation $2.5 billion, while the IMF approved a $2.1 billion support package announced earlier.
BEIJING China announced a complete overhaul of its dairy industry to improve safety at every step. Changes will be made within the next year in production, purchasing, processing and sales. This year, milk and milk products tainted with melamine, an industrial chemical, have been blamed in the deaths of at least three infants and have sickened more than 50,000 others. Chinese officials also warned that the country faces a "grim" employment outlook with demand for workers falling and job seekers in the cities outnumbering new jobs by two-to-one as the economy slows. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.7 percent, a modest loss compared with other Asian trading, after speculation over a possible deal by Disney to build a theme park in Shanghai boosted property shares.
PARIS PSA Peugeot Citroen said it plans to cut at least 2,700 jobs as European car sales plummet. Meanwhile, the government said a 20 billion euro ($25.3 billion) investment fund will help struggling strategic industries. President Nicolas Sarkozy announced immediate aid of 85 million euros ($107 million) for DAHER, an industrial manufacturer. The CAC-40 in France finished down 107.47 points, or 3.5 percent, at 2,980.42.
SEOUL, South Korea In South Korea, the main index fell for its eighth straight session, losing 6.7 percent to 948.69, as the country's currency, the won, fell to its lowest level in more than a decade.
HONG KONG The Hang Seng benchmark sank 517.24 points, or 4 percent, to 12,298.56.
BERLIN Germany's DAX settled 133.89 points, or 3.1 percent, lower at 4,220.20.
BRUSSELS, Belgium European Union agriculture ministers agreed to further reforms of the bloc's farm handout programs, to better compete in global markets and improve the chances of reaching a global trade deal.
TAIPEI, Taiwan Taiwan's economy contracted 1.02 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, its first decline since 2003, the government said. Gross domestic product is also projected to shrink 1.73 percent in the current quarter and drop 0.31 percent in the first quarter of 2009. But the agency said it still expects an increase of 2.12 percent in GDP growth for the whole of 2009. It said that growth in 2008 would likely be 1.87 percent. The weighted price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange fell 194.16 points, or 4.5 percent, to close at 4,089.93.
MOSCOW Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin promised the country would emerge stronger from a world economic crisis he said was triggered by U.S. recklessness. He proposed tax breaks to help the economy. Meanwhile, the finance minister said that Russia's 2009 year budget may see a deficit of up to 1 percent, the first shortfall in years. On the international front, Putin said Russia will provide up to $1 billion to the International Monetary Fund to add to reserves intended to help countries hit by the crisis. Russia would also provide credits to China and India to encourage them to buy Russian goods, and give Belarus a $2 billion loan.
RIGA, Latvia Latvia will ask the European Union and the International Monetary Fund for financial assistance to stabilize its financial and banking systems. For the past three years, Latvia has boasted the highest rate of growth in the 27-member EU, but third quarter data released earlier this month shows the country now has one of Europe's most troubled economies. Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis refused to specify how much the country would ask for, but said talks had already started with the European Commission.
SYDNEY, Australia Despite a bleak report that forecasts a possible recession in 2009, the central bank chief says the country is in a good position to defend itself against the global economic crisis because of its tight monetary and fiscal policy. Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 dropped 4.2 percent, or 146.7 points, to close at 3352.9, as weakening commodity prices dragged down the country's resource giants.
SAO PAULO, Brazil The Ibovespa index of Brazil was down 2 percent at midday, while Argentina's Merval plummeted 5.8 percent.
BANGKOK, Thailand General Motors Corp. said Thursday it will stop production at its Thai plant for up to two months, joining other global vehicle manufacturers in cutting production as the global downturn hits sales.
ANKARA, Turkey Turkey is in talks with the International Monetary Fund over a possible loan to help its economy weather the impact of the global financial crisis. Mehmet Simsek, the economy minister, said the conditions and size of the possible loan were still to be determined. Newspaper reports have said a deal would give the country access to as much as $40 billion, if needed, in IMF funds.
QUITO, Ecuador A commission auditing Ecuador's foreign debt has recommended that the country halt payments on three bonds worth $3.9 billion after finding "illegalities" in the obligations. The global 2012, 2015 and 2030 bonds in question are the product of a debt refinancing in 2000.
