A look at economic developments and stock market activity around the world Monday:
LONDON HSBC PLC, Europe's largest bank by market value, reported a 70 percent drop in 2008 net profit and said it would raise $17.7 billion in new capital through a share issue while cutting 6,100 jobs as it shutters consumer loan businesses in the U.S. HSBC said it would scale back lending in the U.S. after being stung by the collapse in subprime mortgage-backed securities although its HSBC Bank USA branch retail banking business will remain. Britain's FTSE 100 sank to lows not seen since April 2003. The UK index closed 5.3 percent down at 3,625.83.
MOSCOW Russia's finance minister predicted the national economy will grow 2 to 3 percent in 2010, after a 2.2 percent decline this year, but warned that Russia is not likely to profit from lofty oil prices in the near term. The budget deficit now projected at 8 percent of GDP this year should drop to 3 percent in 2011, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin added. Russian GDP contracted by 8.8 percent in January compared with a year earlier. Unemployment rates are soaring and the ruble has lost one-third of its value since September.
SHANGHAI Chinese manufacturing contracted again, to 45.1, in February, but at a slower rate than the previous month's 42.2, according to a survey of factories issued by brokerage CLSA. CLSA's purchasing manager's index based on a survey of some 400 companies showed manufacturing shrank in February for the seventh straight month. A number below 50 on the 100-point index indicates contraction. The survey came as China's legislature and a top government advisory body gathered in Beijing for annual meetings that are widely expected to yield further measures to stimulate the economy. Chinese shares rose after falling more than 10 percent over the past two weeks. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index edged up 10.59 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 2,093.45. The Shenzhen Composite Index for China's second exchange gained 2.1 percent to 672.85.
BERLIN Germany's economy minister said the government would not be pushed into a hasty decision following General Motors Corp.'s Opel unit request for 3.3 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in aid. Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg met with the bosses of Adam Opel GmbH at his ministry to discuss a plan the company drew up last week. In markets, Germany's DAX dropped 3.5 percent to 3,710.07 and France's CAC 40 plunged 4.5 percent to 2,581.46.
TORONTO The Canadian economy contracted at a 3.4 percent annual pace at the end of 2008, the biggest decline since 1991, but not as large a contraction as in the United States or Japan. Finance minister Jim Flaherty had indicated he expected the report from Statistics Canada would show the economy has fallen off the table. Economists forecast Canada's gross domestic product would shrink between 3 or 4 percent in the October-December quarter.
TOKYO Japanese auto sales plunged 32.4 percent in February, the biggest monthly drop since 1974 on sinking demand as the global economic downturn deepens, industry group Japan Automobile Dealers Association said. Japanese consumers bought 218,212 vehicles for the month, marking the seventh consecutive month of year-on-year declines. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 stock average dropped 288.27, or 3.8 percent, to 7,280.15.
BRUSSELS German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other EU leaders flatly rejected a new multibillion euro bailout for eastern Europe on Sunday, suggesting that additional aid be given to struggling nations only on a case-by-case basis. That tough stance came even as Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany warned that the global credit crunch was creating a widening economic chasm in the 27-nation bloc which threatened to rend Europe.
WARSAW, Poland Poland's economic growth slowed sharply to 2.9 percent in last year's fourth quarter as the global crisis began to take its toll on the country. The estimated year-on-year increase in gross domestic product compared with growth of 4.8 percent in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the economy grew by a healthy 6.5 percent.
SEOUL, South Korea South Korea's currency fell sharply, hitting fresh 11-year lows as investors dumped stocks amid general pessimism about the world economy and nagging local fears of a dollar shortage. The won fell to 1,575.4 against the U.S. dollar, its lowest close since March 11, 1998, when South Korea was in the throes of the Asian financial crisis. The South Korean currency has now fallen about 20 percent so far this year against the dollar after a nearly 26 percent drop in 2008, making it one of the world's worst performers. The benchmark Kospi tumbled 4.2 percent to a three-month low of 1,018.81 amid a broad decline in Asian regional markets.
PRAGUE The EU warned member states not to resort to protectionism as a way of fighting the global economic crisis. The prime minister of the Czech Republic, which holds the 27-nation bloc's rotating presidency, said there should be no restrictions placed on foreign competitors.
"Protectionism is evil, it is like poison," Mirek Topolanek said, echoing fears that eastern European nations could be left behind as their economies slow down because of the crisis. He called for more liberalization of trade within the EU as well as further eastward enlargement. There are several other candidates to become EU members, including Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey.
HONG KONG Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 494.11 points, 3.9 percent, to 12,317.46. Markets in Australia, Taiwan, India and Singapore shed nearly 3 percent or more.
MEXICO CITY Mexico's battered peso weakened to a new record low of 15.472 against the dollar. Mexico sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States and has been pummeled by the U.S. downturn. Mexico's central bank has sold more than $18 billion dollars since October to try to stop the peso's fall. The peso has lost about 35 percent of its value against the dollar since August, despite the bank's efforts. Mexican media reported that Treasury Secretary Agustin Carstens believes the peso is undervalued. During a visit to Portugal on Sunday, he attributed the currency's fall to an overreaction of the market.
