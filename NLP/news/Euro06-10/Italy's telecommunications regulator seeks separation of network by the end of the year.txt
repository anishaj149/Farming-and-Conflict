Italy's telecommunications regulator AGCOM said Tuesday it wants Telecom Italia SpA to put its fixed-line network under separate management by the end of the year to increase competition in the market.
AGCOM's Chairman Corrado Calabro told a parliamentary hearing in Rome that Telecom Italia is still the dominant operator in both wholesale and retail fixed-line markets, and the "functional separation" of its network is a solution in the interest of all operators.
AGCOM has already proposed putting Telecom Italia's fixed-line network under independent management, following the model used in Britain to grant fair access to all industry players.
Under the proposal, the network would be put in a ring-fenced division that would be separated from the rest of Telecom Italia activities and controlled by a board made up mostly of members nominated by the watchdog.
Later Tuesday, Telecom Italia said its first-half earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, fell 3.1 percent compared to the same period in 2006.
The company said its EBITDA fell to €6.314 billion (US$8.73 billion) from €6.518 billion a year earlier, as the group's domestic operations continued to be under pressure, while its Brazil mobile and European broadband businesses booked strong performances.
Before the results, Telecom Italia shares on the Milan stock exchange closed down 1.4 percent at €2.06 (US$2.85), in line with a negative overall market.
