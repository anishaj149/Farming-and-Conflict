Luxottica Group, one of the world's leading eyewear makers, said Thursday that it will pay $90US million (€70.55 million) to acquire about 100 optical stores in the United States.
The deal to acquire D.O.C Optics, a retail business whose stores are mainly located in the Midwest, represents a further expansion of Luxottica's operations in North America.
"Our North American retail business is today on track to deliver strong results for 2006, yet we believe that there continue to be opportunities for significant additional growth in that market," Leonardo Del Vecchio, chairman of Luxottica Group, said in a statement. "The D.O.C Optics transaction represents another key step in our long-stated strategy to maximize growth opportunities for our optical retail brands, including LensCrafters and Pearle Vision."
Luxottica Group said in the statement that it expected the total purchase price, net of expected tax benefits, to total about $90US million (€70.55 million). The deal is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of next year.
D.O.C Optics stores operate in the U.S. states of Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin, Florida and Illinois with a majority of its retail locations in and around the Detroit metropolitan area. D.O.C Optics is projected to post system revenues for fiscal year 2006 in excess of $100US million (€78.39 million).
Italy-based Luxottica is a global leader in eyewear and maker of Ray-Ban and other high-end brands.
