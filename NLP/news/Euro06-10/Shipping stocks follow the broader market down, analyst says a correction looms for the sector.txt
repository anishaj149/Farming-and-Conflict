Shares of seaborne shipping companies traded down for a second consecutive day, pressured by concerns over interest rates on two continents and whether the stocks can maintain recent momentum.
Shares of Frontline Ltd., one of the world's largest publicly traded crude oil shippers and one of the few names in the sector to post gains on Tuesday, fell $2.62, or 5.6 percent, to $43.74 in afternoon trading. Shares of Teekay Shippng Corp., another big name in crude oil transportation, lost $2.09, or 3.4 percent, to $59.58. Shares of Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. retreated $2.49, or 3.2 percent, to $76.67, while shares of Ship Finance International Ltd. fell 48 cents to $30.39. Shares of Knightsbridge Tankers Ltd. gave up 77 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $30.48.
Among dry bulk carriers, which have witnessed stronger fundamentals in recent months and even helped prop up the broader maritime shipping sector as a whole, shares of Diana Shipping fell 52 cents to $67.49. Shares of DryShips Inc. lost $1.77, or 4.3 percent, to $39.28, and shares of Danaos Corp. traded down 49 cents to $31.41. Shares of Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc., lost 38 cents to $22.26.
The activity came amid interest rate concerns in the U.S. and Europe, which pushed the broader markets down for a second straight day. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted Tuesday that signs of strength in the economy reduces the chances of an interest rate cut. On Wednesday, Europe's Central Bank raised its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4 percent, its highest level in six years. Stocks in Europe fell sharply on the news. Higher interest rates make everything from car loans to home mortgages more expensive.
Most shipping stocks also traded lower on Tuesday, partly because they followed the broader markets down but also because of comments from an analyst at Citigroup questioning whether tanker stocks can maintain their current momentum. The stocks are up 50 percent this year, according to John Kartsonas, but charter rates for crude carriers remain in line with 2006 and first-quarter earnings arrived below last year's levels. Given their lack of catalysts, Kartsonas thinks a 25 percent swoon could occur among the petroleum shippers if a correction takes place.
"We continue to believe that currently there is limited value in any of the tanker stocks we cover as valuations have reached unsustainable levels," Kartsonas said in a note to investors after the markets closed on Monday. "Even for the more short-term focused investors, current stock price levels should remain captive to momentum, and any change in psychology should lead to sharp downward adjustments, something that history has shown to be the rule rather than the exception in this sector."
