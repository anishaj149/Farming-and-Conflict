Parisians seeking relief from baking temperatures flocked to the banks of the Seine Thursday for the opening of Paris Beaches a city-sponsored initiative that turns the river into a faux-tropical getaway.
Tourists and Parisians relaxed on artificial beaches, sunning themselves on deck chairs and receiving free massages.
Now in its fifth year, the monthlong event expands this summer to include a new half-mile stretch of white sand on the Left Bank.
"It's fun because it's in the middle of the city," said Sarah, a 20-year-old Australian student sunbathing in a bikini. "We came to the city and it just happens that it's on. It's lively."
The heat wave blamed for as many as nine deaths in France continued to bake Europe.
In Germany, technicians cut output at three nuclear power stations because river water used to cool their turbines had become too warm.
Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe inaugurated Paris Beaches in 2002. Skeptics called it silly and un-Parisian, but visitors embraced the event.
Last year, 3.8 million people atttended, and the idea has inspired European capitals including Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam and Budapest to open similar sand-in-the-city installations. Other towns around France also have followed the capital's lead.
A new attraction in Paris this year is a floating sports complex on the Left Bank that houses a lap pool with a retractable roof.
The complex, named after jazz-era icon Josephine Baker, is the 21st-century version of another floating Paris pool, which sank into the Seine in 1993 after more than two centuries of service.
