The Austrian law making it a crime to deny the Holocaust was enacted in 1992 as an amendment to the 1947 "NS-Verbotsgesetz," a sweeping ban on Nazi activities.
British historian David Irving was charged under Section 3H of the law, which threatens a prison term of up to 10 years for "whoever denies, grossly plays down, approves or tries to excuse the National Socialist genocide or other National Socialist crimes against humanity in a print publication, in broadcast or other media."
The law also forbids the formation of any neo-Nazi party, with a sentence of 10-20 years for those convicted of founding or organizing such a group.
Between 1999 and 2004, there were 158 convictions under the law, the Justice Ministry said, citing its most recent figures. Most of the convictions stemmed from Section 3H offenses.
