Italy's telecommunications regulator AGCOM said Tuesday it wants Telecom Italia SpA to put its fixed-line network under separate management by the end of the year to increase competition in the market.
AGCOM's Chairman Corrado Calabro told a parliamentary hearing in Rome that Telecom Italia is still the dominant operator in both wholesale and retail fixed-line markets, and the "functional separation" of its network is a solution in the interest of all operators.
AGCOM has already proposed putting Telecom Italia's fixed-line network under independent management, following the model used in Britain to grant fair access to all industry players.
Under the proposal, the network would be put in a ring-fenced division that would be separated from the rest of Telecom Italia activities and controlled by a board made up mostly of members nominated by the watchdog.
