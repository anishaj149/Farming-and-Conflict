A cricket player for England has an explanation for his drunken-driving charge: He needed to buy tools to rescue his trapped cat.
Graeme Swann was stopped by police in April and appeared in court Monday. The officer who stopped him at 3 a.m. says the spin bowler was upset because his cat was under the floorboards of his house.
Constable Steven Denniss says Swann cooperated. Swann denied the charge of drunken driving despite a blood test showing he was slightly over the legal alcohol limit.
