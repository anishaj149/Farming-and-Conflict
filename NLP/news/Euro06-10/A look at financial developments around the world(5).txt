A look at what happened in some stock markets around the world Monday:
VIENNA, Austria An Austrian bank has become the country's first financial institution to ask the state for help because of the worldwide financial meltdown. The Vienna-based Kommunalkredit says it has begun talks with the Finance Ministry over measures to ensure the bank's liquidity and stability. The Austria Press Agency said the talks focused on the possibility of the state acquiring part of the bank, the country's eighth largest, or of an increase in the bank's holdings by its present shareholders.
TOKYO Japan's key stock index plunged more than 6 percent to its lowest close in more than a quarter century as investors grew increasingly gloomy about the outlook for the world's No. 2 economy. Unnerved by the financial crisis fallout and the yen's recent surge, investors unloaded banks and exporters like Toyota and Sony. The Nikkei 225 index shed 486.18 points, or 6.36 percent, to 7,162.90 its lowest closing level since October 1982. The benchmark has lost more than 20 percent since last Monday and nearly 40 percent in the last month. The broader Topix index posted an even steeper fall of 7.4 percent to 746.46. Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso told senior officials to draw up measures to calm volatile stock markets and to fend off further fallout from the global financial crisis. Although Aso did not suggest intervention in foreign exchange markets, the Group of Seven finance ministers and their countries' central bank governors expressed concern about the yen's movement.
BANGKOK, Thailand Trading on the Thai stock market was temporarily halted after the benchmark index tumbled 10 percent, triggering an automatic 30-minute break. The Stock Exchange of Thailand, or SET, index was at 389.58 points when trading was suspended, said exchange President Pattariya Benjaphonchai. It ended up closing the day down 45.4 points, or 10.5 percent, at 387.43.
MANILA, Philippines Philippine stocks plummeted with steep losses triggering a circuit-breaker that automatically halted trading for 15 minutes. The Stock Exchange index plunged 239.66 points, or 12.3 percent, to 1,713.83 points, the lowest close since September 2004 and the biggest one-day drop since February 2007. Decliners outnumbers gainers 123 to five, with 13 stocks unchanged.
TAIPEI, Taiwan Taiwan shares plummeted 4.65 percent on after the government ended a temporary measure that halved the daily decline limit for stocks. The weighted price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange fell 212.75 points to close at 4,366.87 points. The government halved the 7 percent daily decline limit to 3.5 percent for the past two weeks to restrain a sell-off amid the global financial meltdown.
HONG KONG Hong Kong's main stock index plunged more than 12 percent, closing at its lowest point in more than four years amid deepening fears about the world economy and company profits. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index tumbled 1,602.54 points, or 12.7 percent, to 11,015.84 its worst close since May 2004. The benchmark is off more than 50 percent this year.
SHANGHAI, China China's key stock index slumped to its lowest level in more than two years, as investors reacted to dismal earnings reports and selloffs in overseas markets. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index lost 6.3 percent, or 116.27 points, to 1,723.35. It was the index's lowest close since it ended trading at 1,712.64 on Sept. 26, 2006. The Shenzhen Composite Index lost 6.5 percent to 472.99.
FRANKFURT, Germany Germany's benchmark DAX index managed to swing into positive territory, closing 38.97 points higher at 4334.64 after being down almost 5 percent in early trading. The rally was helped by a massive 147 percent jump in Volkswagen AG stock after Porsche said it plans to lift its stake in the automaker to 75 percent by 2009.
PARIS The CAC 40 in France fell 4 percent at 3,067 after being almost 7 percent lower. Renault SA and Peugeot SA fared worst after saying they are expecting to be hit hard by the economic downturn.
LONDON The British FTSE 100 fell 37.22 points, or 1.0 percent, to 3846.14.
KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait A delegation of disgruntled Kuwaiti stock brokers marched to the office of Kuwait's ruling emir Monday to ask him to temporarily close the plunging stock exchange. Panic spread in the market Sunday after the Kuwaiti central bank ordered trading halted in the shares of the country's Gulf Bank because of high derivatives losses. Although the Kuwait Central Bank quickly stepped in to prop up the bank and say it was proposing an urgent draft bill to guarantee deposits, many of Gulf Bank's clients rushed to withdraw their money from its branches around the small oil-rich state.
SYDNEY, Australia Australia's central bank has taken the rare step of buying Australian dollars twice in the past few days to limit the currency's dramatic plunge. The Reserve Bank of Australia acted on Friday night and again on Monday morning. A bank spokesman declined to say how much it had spent on the interventions.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina Argentina's Merval index dropped 5.67 percent to close at 839.77 as private pension funds returned to the market for the first time since President Cristina Fernandez announced plans to nationalize nearly $30 billion in private retirement investments. Brazil's Ibovespa stock index dropped as well, down 6.4 percent to 30,975, driven by some of the biggest Brazilian companies, which are suffering from commodity price drops. Stocks had mixed results elsewhere in Latin America Monday.
