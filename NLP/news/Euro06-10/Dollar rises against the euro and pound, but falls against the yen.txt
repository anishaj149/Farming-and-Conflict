The dollar rose against the euro and pound Thursday, buoyed by foreign investors buying U.S. investments amid disappointing economic data.
The 13-nation euro bought $1.3086 in afternoon New York trading, down from $1.3165 in New York late Wednesday. The British pound dropped to $1.9443 from $1.9505.
However, the dollar slipped against the Japanese currency, falling to 119.08 yen from 119.35 yen.
"What's happening against the yen is that the dollar is going up against the 120 ceiling and is unable to break it," said Michael Woolfolk, a senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York.
The dollar had gained significantly on Wednesday after a survey showed that U.S. manufacturing expanded in December. But new economic data on Thursday showed a less than upbeat picture of the economy.
Orders to U.S. factories posted a smaller-than-expected increase in November, while the U.S. service sector grew at a slower pace in December than November. Merchants in all retail categories reported disappointing sales in December, and the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week.
However, that failed to put a dent in the dollar's gains against the euro and pound.
"We're seeing some type of beginning-of-the-year asset reallocation by global fund managers," Woolfolk said. "And the weighting of U.S. securities in these funds are substantial, which gives the dollar a boost."
The euro has benefited recently from expectations, fed by U.S. economic data, that the gap between European and U.S. rates would narrow as the Fed holds or even cuts interest rates and the European Central Bank raises them.
Key U.S. payroll data, due on Friday, could provide more pointers to the Fed's next move and give currency markets new direction.
In other trading, the dollar bought 1.2329 Swiss francs, up from 1.2254 late Wednesday, and 1.1775 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1720.
