Some of the cases pending before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in the Hague:
 On Friday, judges deliver their verdict on Naser Oric, a Bosnian Muslim commander who led resistance to Serb fighters in and around Srebrenica. He is charged with the murder of Serbs in 1992 and 1993 and the wanton destruction of Serb villages.
 Momcilo Krajisnik, former speaker of the Bosnian Serb parliament and political right hand to former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, recently completed marathon testimony in his own defense denying knowledge of well documented atrocities.
 The prosecution rested earlier this month in the trial of Milan Martic, a wartime leader of Croatia's breakaway minority Serbs accused of shelling the city of Zagreb.
 The trial began in April of six ethnic Croatian politicians and military officers on charges of torturing, killing and expelling Muslims in southeastern Bosnia. It is shedding light on the role of the Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who died in 1999 before he could be indicted for war crimes.
