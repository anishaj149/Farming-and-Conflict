Stocks finished Thursday's session on a mixed note, as concerns about the weakened dollar and higher interest rates blunted the positive effects of a comeback in Mexican stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 3.03 at 3,859.00. The blue chip index hovered at slightly lower levels for most of the session, as cautious investors sold or took to the sidelines in the face of several cross currents.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,124 to 1,066 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 312.51 million shares, down from 346.28 million Wednesday.
Broad market indexes were mixed. The NYSE's composite index was unchanged at 251.72. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.02 to 461.64.
But the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.77 to 756.51, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index added 0.23 to 434.89.
"Investors are in a cautious mood, given the anxiety in the currency markets," said Bob Walberg, market analyst at MMS International. "That, in addition to soft bonds, is keeping stocks from doing much in the way of the upside."
The dollar was driven lower, to 98 Japanese yen and 1.53 Deutsche marks, amid concern that the Mexican financial crisis would hurt the U.S. economy. Bonds were down 17-32 point and yielding 7.87 percent, pulled lower by the weak dollar and surging precious metals prices.
Also pressuring stocks was the fear that Mexico's problems might negatively affect the earnings of U.S. companies that do business in Mexico or rely heavily on selling their products in Mexico, and that the crisis might spread throughout Latin America.
Concerns about Mexico persisted despite a pickup in the Mexican stock market and the Mexican peso. The Mexican Bolsa's key IPC index rose nearly 4.5 percent, but the American depositary receipts of Mexican companies were mixed.
The ADRs of Telefonos de Mexico rose to 36 1/8, on leading NYSE volume. The ADRs of Grupo Televisa rose to 25 1/8, but Grupo Tribasa fell to 11 1/8.
Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, attributed the weakness in stocks to "very normal profit-taking" after strong runups in blue chip issues last month. The Dow has gained more than 150 points since closing at 3,700.87 last Dec. 1.
The U.S. stock and bond markets had little reaction to a Labor Department report that new claims for jobless benefits jumped by 17,000 last week to 355,000, the highest level in nearly six months. Analysts blamed the increase on seasonal variations, and many expect the increase to be reversed in coming weeks.
Meanwhile, the Atlanta Federal Reserve said its index of area business activity fell to 11.1 in December from 17.7 in November. The regional prices-received index fell to 13.8 from 22.2, but the prices-paid index rose to 49.1 from 48.4.
Intel rose to 67 in Nasdaq trading, and Advanced Micro Devices surged 3 to 31 1/2 on the Big Board. The two companies said late Wednesday that they had settled all litigation against each other surrounding AMD's rights to sell clones of Intel's microprocessors.
Banking stocks were mixed after earnings reports. Citicorp slumped 1 to 39, despite reporting strong preliminary fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts and investors fretted about the long-term implications to Citicorp of Mexico's currency crisis, even after Citicorp said the effect on the bank would be minimal.
J.P. Morgan rallied 1/2 to 57 after the company released fourth-quarter earnings that indicated trading losses were not as steep as analysts had feared.
Gold stocks moved higher with gold prices. Spot gold was up $ 4.20 per ounce in New York.
Overseas stock markets were mixed, with the Nikkei index in Tokyo down 0.7 percent but Frankfurt's DAX index gaining 0.5 percent. In London, the FT-SE 100 index was down 0.53 percent.
