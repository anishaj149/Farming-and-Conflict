Caring for Cokey; Sheepdog May Become Drug Program Ambassador
 An Old English sheepdog nicknamed "Cokey" for the five pounds of cocaine discovered in her belly may become an ambassador in school drug awareness programs.
The 4-year-old shaggy dog arrived Dec. 1 at Kennedy Airport on a flight from Bogota, Colombia. She was lethargic and dehydrated, and X-rays revealed she was carrying 10 cocaine-filled bags with a street value of $ 250,000 in her stomach.
Cokey is recovering at the U.S. Customs Canine Enforcement Training Center in Front Royal, Va.
The agency said that Cokey "may very well turn out to be the best ambassador the U.S. Customs Service will have for the drug awareness programs that are presented to school children."
She would visit schools "to show children what happened to her, to show what they did to her to get the drugs into the country," said Joan Baran, a spokeswoman for the agency.
Baran said Cokey is "eating well, but still has 25 pounds to gain."
A New Jersey man who came to claim the dog was charged with possession of drugs with intent to distribute.
