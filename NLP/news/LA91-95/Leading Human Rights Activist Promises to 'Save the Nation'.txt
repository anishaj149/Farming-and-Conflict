One of Guatemala's leading human rights advocates was sworn in as president Sunday, after the powerful military permitted Congress to hold a special election.
The election of Ramiro de Leon Carpio late Saturday restored democratic rule to the Central American country days after the ouster of Jorge Serrano, who seized near-dictatorial powers on May 25.
Serrano's vice president, backed by the military, attempted to succeed him, but was thwarted by opposition lawmakers and the country's Constitutional Court.
The choice of a human rights activist to lead Guatemala was unprecedented in a country with a poor rights record, a prolonged civil war and a military that has long been involved in daily politics.
Questions remain about the ability of the military to stay on the sidelines. Although the army permitted Congress to elect the president, the defense minister stopped short of saying that the army would back its choice.
Later in the day, De Leon Carpio called for a purge of the army, the Congress and other government institutions, although he said his first priority was to restore democracy.
On Wednesday, Serrano's vice president, Gustavo Espina Salguero, with the support of the military, declared himself president until Serrano's term expired in 1996.
The move touched off demonstrations by Guatemalans who saw it as a military coup. Opposition lawmakers blocked Espina's power grab by boycotting a congressional session, depriving him of the quorum he needed to be sworn in.
The revolt against Espina was given weight Friday when Guatemala's Constitutional Court ruled he had been a "co-participant" in Serrano's assumption of emergency powers and disqualified his claim to the presidency. The court gave Congress 24 hours to find Serrano's successor.
De Leon Carpio said in his inaugural speech that his mission was "to save the nation" and promised to appeal for the release of tens of millions of dollars in foreign aid suspended after Serrano seized power.
Along with possible military distrust, his immediate problems include declining living standards, a wide gap between rich and poor, and a 33-year-old leftist insurrection, the last and longest in Central America.
His promise to bring justice to the poor raised high expectations that may be difficult to fill.
"We face a challenge before the world, and before ourselves, to correct our errors and press on to a better destiny," said de Leon Carpio, 51, the government-appointed attorney general for human rights. His office was suspended under the emergency rule.
"Guatemala's international standing must be restored," he said in his inaugural speech.
At his first news conference, de Leon Carpio called for a purge of the army and other government institutions, "with the goal of pacifying Guatemala." Serrano shut Congress and the Supreme Court, complaining they were rife with corruption.
But it was not immediately clear how far the new president could go in reorganizing a powerful military that wields great influence and was the powerbroker that ended Serrano's absolute rule.
He said his first priority "was to consolidate democracy in Guatemala" before tackling an end to the country's long civil war.
De Leon Carpio's election was welcomed by hundreds of jubilant supporters, who surged past a police line and burst into Congress to watch his swearing-in.
The crowd sang the national anthem and cheered as the president donned a ceremonial sash. Fireworks crackled outside and cheering erupted in the street.
Gen. Jose Domingo Garcia Samayoa, the defense minister, promised to let the election proceed, but did not say whether the army would back Congress' choice.
In Washington, the White House said: "We are tentatively encouraged by the restoration of democracy and civilian rule in Guatemala."
In Managua, Nicaragua, where the Organization of American States held informal discussions Sunday, OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares said "constitutional normality" had returned to Guatemala. The OAS had threatened trade sanctions after Serrano declared emergency rule.
The vote count was 107 for de Leon Carpio, six abstentions and two votes for others not nominated.
He will serve out Serrano's term, which ends January 1996.
Ten days ago, de Leon Carpio was placed under house arrest May 25 by troops backed by armored carriers, but escaped over his rooftop and appeared at a clandestine news conference the next day to denounce Serrano's move.
He had long been a fierce critic of the government of Serrano, the first elected civilian president to succeed another in more than 150 years of Guatemalan history.
