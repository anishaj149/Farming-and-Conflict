Emphasizing the need for the protection of the many endangered species throughout the world, the United Nations Postal Administration has issued its second set of stamps in the multiyear series entitled "Endangered Species."
The 1994 set consists of three sheets of 16 stamps - one sheet each for three U.N. currencies (United States, Swiss and Austrian). Four different endangered species are illustrated on each sheet.
The U.S. 29-cent stamps depict the chimpanzee, St. Lucia amazon (a rare parrot), American crocodile and the Dama gazelle (found in Africa).
The 80 franc Swiss denominations portray the Mexican prairie dog, jabiru (a large South American stork), the blue whale, and the golden lion tamarin (a tiny monkey of Brazil).
The 7 schilling Austrian denominations show the ocelot, the white-breasted silver eye (an almost extinct bird of the Pacific area), the Mediterranean monk seal, and the Asian elephant.
Each sheet of stamps includes four marginal inscriptions. The inscriptions feature the emblems of the United Nations and CITES (Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species). The year "1994" is seen between the two emblems.
Released simultaneously by the U.N. Postal Administration is the Endangered Species Annual Collection Folder of single mint stamps. The collection is contained in a specially designed album which devotes separate pages to each of the endangered species with photos of the species. The stamps are not affixed inside the album, although spaces and mounts have been provided.
 
 For information on these and all other UNPA items, you may contact the United Nations Postal Administration, P.O. Box 5900, Grand Central Station, New York, N.Y. 10163-9992, or phone toll free 1-800-234-UNPA.

100th Anniversary Souvenirs
To celebrate the 100th anniversary of postage stamp printing by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the U.S. Postal Service has planned three souvenir cards for 1994.
The first card was released in conjunction with the recent San Diego Stamp Show. The other two cards will be issued at future stamp shows, says the USPS.
The San Diego card features the bureau's first building in Washington, D.C. At the upper right corner is a block of four blue intaglio 10-cent special delivery stamps.
This design originated in 1885 using the phrase "secures immediate delivery at a special delivery office." The original printer, American Bank Note Co., later changed the wording to "secures immediate delivery at any post office."
In 1894, when the Bureau started printing the stamps, the design again was changed. This time the Bureau added a line under the words "10 cents."
 
 The San Diego souvenir card is available from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Public Sales Division, Room 602-11A, 14th and C Sts., Washington, D.C. 20228.
