Excerpts of testimony given Thursday by Rosa Lopez, a former housekeeper for a neighbor of O.J. Simpson, speaking through an interpreter:
(In the following segment, witness Lopez admits under cross-examination she never made plane reservations to leave for El Salvador last Friday. Her testimony is being video-taped without the jury present for possible viewing by the panel later in the trial:)
DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY CHRISTOPHER DARDEN: You told us that you had made reservations last Friday morning, correct?
LOPEZ: Yes.
DARDEN: But you had not, correct?
LOPEZ: Yes.
DARDEN: And you knew that, correct?
LOPEZ: Yes.
DARDEN: And you lied?
LOPEZ: No.
DARDEN: Well, what do you call it?
LOPEZ: Because one doesn't need to make reservations to go around this time. I go with my money, I buy the ticket and they give it to me for the evening.
DARDEN: Not only did you not make reservations last Friday morning, but you didn't admit that fact until I confronted you with proof -
DEFENSE ATTORNEY JOHNNIE COCHRAN JR.: Your honor, objection.
DARDEN: - that you had not made the reservation?
JUDGE LANCE ITO: Overruled.
DARDEN: Correct?
LOPEZ: Yes.
DARDEN: OK. Now, you understand why, why you're still here today, correct?
COCHRAN: Object to that, your honor.
ITO: Overruled.
DARDEN: Correct?
LOPEZ: Yes.

(In the following segment, Lopez admits she doesn't remember when defense investigator William Pavelic interviewed her:)
DARDEN: And who did you speak with at that time?
LOPEZ: With Mr. Bill.
DARDEN: Did you speak with anyone else?
LOPEZ: Not that I can remember.
DARDEN: Well, when you and Mr. Bill first began speaking, did he have a note pad with him?
LOPEZ: I don't remember.
DARDEN: Well, did he write down the things that you said?
LOPEZ: I don't remember.
DARDEN: Did you see paper in the office?
LOPEZ: Sir, it's been a long time since this happened, and I don't remember.
DARDEN: What month was this?
LOPEZ: I don't remember, sir.
DARDEN: Was this in August?
LOPEZ: I don't remember, sir.
DARDEN: Was it during the summer?
LOPEZ: I don't remember, sir.
DARDEN: What year was it?
LOPEZ: I just know that it was in '94.
DARDEN: Was it on July 29th?
LOPEZ: Maybe.
DARDEN: Now, a moment ago you told us you couldn't recall the season, the date, the month or the time of day?
COCHRAN: That's complex and argumentative.
ITO: Overruled.
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.
DARDEN: But you think that perhaps it was June 29th?
LOPEZ: If you say so.
DARDEN: Well, I'm not saying so. I'm asking you to say so, ma'am.
LOPEZ: It's just that I don't remember a date because I don't go writing a date.
DARDEN: Do you have a hard time remembering dates?
COCHRAN: I object to this.
ITO: Overruled.
LOPEZ: No, sir.
DARDEN: Do you have a hard time remembering times?
LOPEZ: If I don't, if I don't have it written down, how can I remember?
DARDEN: Is that the only way you can remember dates and times, is when they are written down?
COCHRAN: Object to that question.
ITO: Overruled.
LOPEZ: No, sir.
DARDEN: Well, isn't that what you just told us a moment ago?
COCHRAN: Objection (inaudible).
ITO: Overruled.
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.
(In the following segment, Lopez admits she doesn't know exactly how long after 10 p.m. she saw Simpson's white Bronco parked in the street outside his Rockingham estate:)
DARDEN: Well, did Mr. Pavelic tell you or mention to you first that you saw the Bronco at 10:15 or 10:20?
LOPEZ: All I said was that it was after 10.
DARDEN: So you don't know how long after 10, correct?
LOPEZ: No, sir.
DARDEN: You don't know how long after 10, yes or no?
LOPEZ: No, sir.
DARDEN: OK. Mr. Pavelic is the one that first suggested 10:15 or 10:20, correct?
COCHRAN: Objection (inaudible).
ITO: Overruled.
LOPEZ: If that's what he's saying, that's fine.
DARDEN: But what you told Mr. Pavelic is that you saw the Bronco sometime after 10 and you don't know how long after 10, correct?
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.

(In the following segment, still under cross-examination, Lopez discusses her interviews with Pavelic:)
DARDEN: Well, you only had two conversations with Mr. Bill, correct?
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.
DARDEN: Well, was it the first time or the second time?
LOPEZ: The second time, sir.
DARDEN: And that second interview you had with Mr. Bill was in August, correct?
LOPEZ: If you say so, sir, that's what it will be.
DARDEN: Is that what you said to Mr. Bill: "If you say so that's the way it will be"?
LOPEZ: It's just that he asks me differently, sir.
DARDEN: In August you told Mr. Bill that you had a friend named Sylvia, correct?
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.
DARDEN: And you told Mr. Bill that Sylvia came by your house for coffee?
LOPEZ: She came to have a cup of coffee with me, sir.
DARDEN: The night of the murders Sylvia came to your house for a cup of coffee.
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.
DARDEN: And that was after 9, correct?
LOPEZ: At about 8:30, sir, or 8:45 - something like that.
DARDEN: Well, did you tell Mr., Mr. Pavelic that, that you saw Mr. Simpson's car between 8:30 and 9?
LOPEZ: What car are you referring to, sir?
DARDEN: Well, did you tell Mr. Pavelic that you saw Mr. Simpson drive off between 8:30 and 9?
COCHRAN: Objection (inaudible).
ITO: Overruled.
THE INTERPRETER: Could you repeat your question, please?
DARDEN: In your second interview, did you tell Mr. Pavelic that you saw Mr. Simpson drive off… Strike that.
COCHRAN: (inaudible).
ITO: Rephrase that.
DARDEN: During your second interview, did you tell Mr. Bill that you saw Mr. Simpson drive off between 8:30 and 9?
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.
DARDEN: OK. And you told him that sometime after that Sylvia came by, correct?
LOPEZ: I don't remember if it was before or after, sir.
DARDEN: Well, you remembered when you talked to Mr. Bill, didn't you?
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.
DARDEN: OK. And you told Mr. Bill 8:30 to 9 was the time that you saw Mr. Simpson drive off, correct?
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.
DARDEN: OK. And the reason you said 8:30 to 9 was because you weren't sure of the exact time, correct?
LOPEZ: Yes, sir.
DARDEN: OK. You were giving him your best estimate, correct?
LOPEZ: That is what I told him, sir.
DARDEN: OK. And the longer that time goes by, the harder it is for you to remember the exact time in which things occur, correct?
LOPEZ: If that's what you say, sir, that's fine.
DARDEN: That's why I'm asking you.
LOPEZ: If you say so, sir, yes.
