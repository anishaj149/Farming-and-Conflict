Here is a look at the Shining Path, whose founder and leader Abimael Guzman has been captured by Peruvian police:
---
GOALS: Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, espouses orthodox Communism. The movement is so hard-line that it hailed the collapse of the Soviet Union, which it viewed as traitors to true Communism, along with the current Chinese government. Followers call Guzman the "fourth sword of Marxism."
---
ORIGINS: Guzman, 57, a former philosophy professor, founded the Shining Path in 1970 as a splinter of the Communist party. It began its armed insurgency in 1980.
---
FOLLOWERS: The movement has an estimated 5,000 armed fighters and thousands of other supporters. The group is widely considered Latin America's most dangerous guerrilla organization, and Gustavo Gorriti, author of a book on the rebel organization, has described Guzman as "democracy's most formidable enemy in South America and probably in the hemisphere."
---
TACTICS: The Shining Path followed the tactics of China's Mao Tse-tung, in conducting a prolonged guerrilla campaign starting in the countryside and aiming to surround and strangle Peru's coastal cities. The guerrillas destroy railroad lines, bridges, power pylons, agricultural research stations - any target that signifies progress.
---
FUNDING: The rebels today receive most of their funding from cocaine traffickers in exchange for protecting their operation.
---
EFFECTS: The government blames the Shining Path for more than $ 22 billion in economic damage over the past decade. More than 25,000 people have died in political violence involving the Shining Path and another guerrilla movement. Most of the victims have been highland peasants caught in the crossfire between security forces and the rebels.
---
RECENT HISTORY: Guzman's capture comes during a crackdown on the guerrillas waged by President Alberto Fujimori, who dissolved the Congress and the judiciary and set up military-backed, one-man rule in April 1992.
---
OUTLOOK: Guzman is expected to be tried by a military court for treason and faces a life sentence without pardon. The harsh measures were announced recently by the government as part of its crackdown on terrorism.
