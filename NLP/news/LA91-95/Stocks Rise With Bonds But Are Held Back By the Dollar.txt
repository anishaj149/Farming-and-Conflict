Stocks followed bonds cautiously higher on Thursday, but they were hampered by continued volatility in the dollar.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended 4.16 higher at 3,983.39, after trading in a narrow 22-point range all day. Of the 30 Dow index components, 11 rose, two were unchanged, and 17 fell.
Big Board volume was moderately heavy at 319.12 million shares as of 4 p.m., down from 349.7 million on Wednesday.
Blue chip issues got a boost from the bond market, where the 30-year Treasury bond was up 11-32 point late in the day.
Bonds were firmer all day, despite a rocky foreign exchange market.
The dollar, which has plunged to all-time lows this week, perked up a bit in early trading after Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the Treasury would intervene to support the dollar "when it makes sense."
But the dollar quickly retreated against the mark and the yen amid ongoing concerns about Latin America. It was trading late in the day at 91.15 yen, down 0.47 yen, but up .0065 Deutsche marks at 1.4045 marks.
Broad stock indexes posted moderate gains. The NYSE's composite index rose 0.01 to 261.61. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.02 to 483.16.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.43 to 796.24. The American Stock Exchange's market value index climbed 1.55 to 451.50.
"The market is just waiting for another shoe to drop," said John Burnett, a trader at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. "There is a good deal of caution. Most people are crossing their fingers, hoping to see some stabilization in South America and Mexico."
Still, many traders and analysts were impressed with the market's strength in the face of the dollar's weakness. "Who can feel too terrible about this market, which is still within striking distance of its all-time high?" Burnett said.
The Labor Department said new unemployment claims rose by 4,000 last week. But investors were more focused on February payroll and unemployment data due out on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to show a gain of 222,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate is expected to move down 0.1 percent to 5.5 percent.
Some analysts said if the numbers show unexpected growth in the economy, that would give the Federal Reserve some justification to raise interest rates to support the dollar.
Stocks would normally react negatively to higher interest rates. But "oddly enough, a Fed tightening here is going to be supportive to the market in that it takes the downward pressure off the dollar," said Bob Walberg, market analyst at MMS International.
Thom Brown, managing director at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood in Philadelphia, doesn't believe the Fed will risk an economic downturn with a further tightening.
But even if it does, the affect on the stock market and the dollar would be minimal, he asserted. "All the interest rate increases we've seen over the year until today, certainly haven't done anything to bolster the dollar."
Bank stocks fell on rumors that J.P. Morgan had suffered big foreign exchange trading losses in Latin America. Morgan said it saw no reason to release its quarterly results early. Its stock finished down 1 at 62 1/2. But shares of Citicorp, which also has a large presence in Latin America were up 1/2 at 40 1/2.
Semiconductor stocks rose, then fell back, then rallied again after the Semiconductor Industry Association said its book-to-bill ratio rose last month. Intel added 7-16 to 80 3-16 in Nasdaq trading. IBM rose to 80 .
But National Semiconductor fell to 17 after the chip maker said its third-quarter net earnings were 43 cents per primary share, down from 48 cents a year ago.
Overseas stock markets were mixed, up in Tokyo but down in Frankfurt and London.
