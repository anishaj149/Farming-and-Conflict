"Elementary, my dear Watson, the game is afoot."
Sherlock Holmes, the world famous detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is honored on a new set of five stamps released by Great Britain.
The stamps depict five of his most popular cases, featuring memorable supporting characters in those stories. The set is se-tenant (attached) each bearing a face value of 24 pence.
The illustrations highlight "The Reigate Square," "The Hound of the Baskervilles," "The Six Napoleans," "The Greek Interpreter," and "The Final Problem."
In "The Final Problem" in 1893, Holmes plunged to his death at the Reichenbach Falls in Austria, while wrestling with his arch enemy, Professor Moriarty. But after much public pressure,the author was forced to resurrect Holmes in 1903 with "The Adventure of the Empty House." Doyle died in 1930, three years after his last Holmes mystery.

Recalling World War II
Guyana, located on the northeast coast of South America, has released a philatelic tribute to World War II's 50th anniversary, highlighting major events on land, sea and air in 1943. Some of the events occurred in 1944.
The sheetlets of horizontal stamps are similar in format to the U.S. Postal Service sheetlets released last May 31 honoring 1943's war efforts.
One set of particular interest to U.S. war buffs and stamp collectors alike features the following: Audie Murphy, the most decorated serviceman in the U.S.; British and U.S. forces linking up in France in 1944; a U.S. howitzer team aiding in the capture of Monte Casino in 1944; the Japanese battleship Yamato being attacked by U.S. aircraft; Red Square in Moscow where the foreign ministers gathered for a conference in 1943; Gen. George Patton leading American forces to victory in Sicily in 1943.
A second set recalls the war in the air 50 years ago. The stamps show such scenes as the first U.S. daylight raid over Germany in 1943; bombers raiding the Ploesti oil refineries in Romania, and the shooting down of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto's plane in the Pacific.
A third set from Guyana concentrates on the war at sea. Illustrated are Lt. John F. Kennedy's PT boat 109 on patrol, the Italian fleet surrendering at Malta and the British battleship HMS Duke of York sinking the German battleship Scharnhorst.
