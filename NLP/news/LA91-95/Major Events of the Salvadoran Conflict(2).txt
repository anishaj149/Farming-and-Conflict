Here are some key events in recent history of El Salvador, whose government and leftist rebels appeared close to a comprehensive peace agreement on Wednesday.
Oct. 15, 1979 - A coup led by two moderate colonels, Jaime Abdul Gutierrez and Adolfo Arnoldo Majano, deposes Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero's rightist military government. The colonels name a 12-member cabinet a week later.
January 1980 - Two junta members and most of the cabinet resign claiming government is moving too slowly on social reforms. Some join the leftist movement. Three civilians are named to the junta, which eventually announces banking and land reforms aimed at defusing the tense situation.
March 9, 1980 - Jose Napoleon Duarte, head of El Salvador's Christian Democrat Party, joins the junta replacing Hector Dada, who quit.
March 24, 1980 - A sniper kills Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero as the outspoken churchman celebrates Mass. Rightists are suspected, and the killing escalates the country's civil war.
Dec. 2, 1980 - Three American nuns and a lay churchworker are abducted as they leave the international airport. They are found buried in a shallow grave two days later and the United States temporarily suspends economic and military aid. Six National Guard troops later are arrested in the case.
Dec. 13, 1980 - Duarte is named El Salvador's first civilian president in 49 years and leads a four-member civilian-military junta that also serves as the legislature.
Jan. 4, 1981 - Michael Hammer and David Pearlman, two American labor officials, are shot to death along with Jose Rodolfo Viera, who heads the Salvadoran land reform, in the coffee shop of a San Salvador hotel.
Jan. 11, 1981 - Guerrillas announce a "final offensive," their first concerted push for military victory. It flops when massive support of the people they were counting on does not materialize.
March 28, 1982 - Salvadorans elect a 60-member constituent assembly dominated by a right-wing bloc. It names an independent banker, Alvaro Magana, interim president in April.
May 25, 1983 - U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Albert Schaufelberger III is shot to death by guerrillas, the first American military adviser to die in the war.
May 6, 1984 - Duarte defeats rightist leader Roberto d'Aubuisson in a runoff for the presidency.
Oct. 15, 1984 - Duarte and other government leaders meet with guerrillas in the northern town of La Palma in their first attempt to negotiate a peace. By this time the war has claimed more than 50,000 lives. No firm agreements are reached.
March 31, 1985 - Duarte's Christian Democrats regain control of the National Assembly.
Sept. 10, 1985 - President Duarte's daughter, Ines Guadalupe, is kidnapped and held for 44 days before being freed in exchange for more than 100 political prisoners.
Oct. 10, 1986 - An earthquake kills an estimated 1,500 people in the capital.
Nov. 16, 1989 - During the biggest guerrilla offensive of the war, army troops enter the campus of the University of Central America and kill six Jesuit professors, their housekeeper and her daughter. Nine military men including four officers are charged.
June 1, 1990 - Rightist Alfredo Cristiani, who defeated a divided, dispirited Christian Democrat Party in presidential elections, takes power.
Feb. 23, 1990 - Duarte dies after a long fight with cancer at age 64.
Sept. 25, 1991 - Guerrillas and the government agree to a joint civilian police force after eight days of talks at the United Nations, the biggest breakthrough to date in nearly seven years of negotiations.
Nov. 5, 1991 - After several deadlocked sessions, rebel and government representatives meet again in Mexico City for yet another round of talks behind closed doors.
 
 Nov. 14, 1991 -In an effort to break the deadlock on how to concert a truce, the rebels announce a unilateral cease-fire until further notice so negotiations could continue. They pledge not to mount attacks or even fire back if attacked, except in extreme circumstances. Cristiani's government says it is analyzing the situation.
