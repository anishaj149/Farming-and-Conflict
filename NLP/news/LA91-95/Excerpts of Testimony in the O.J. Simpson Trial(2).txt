Excerpts from the O.J. Simpson murder trial Thursday:
(In the following segment, without the jury present, the defense argues that Lori Menzione, a Chicago travel agent, should be allowed to testify:)
DEFENSE ATTORNEY CARL DOUGLAS: Ms. Menzione, I can tell you as an officer of the court, would testify that during the course of her conversation with Mr. Simpson, she heard a crash-like sound in the background and Mr. Simpson said, "Hold on. Hold on. Hold on." She then heard a sound that she distinctly thought was the sound of water running. She will testify, your honor, that the crash-like sound that she heard was similar to a sound of someone wiping clean a table or something nearby and then things scattering. And that's the motion that she was using when she was trying to describe the nature of the sound that she heard. I spoke with her about it yesterday. She will say that after hearing the "hold on," she then heard water running. And Mr. Simpson then returned to the phone and said, "I cut myself and I'm bleeding."
(In the following segment, prosecutor Cheri Lewis argues that testimony of Christian Reichardt, ex-boyfriend of Faye Resnick, should not be allowed in defense effort to support theory that drug hitmen committed the killings:)
LEWIS: Number one, there has to be identified third party. They can't say some drug seller somewhere in the universe. There has to be some identified suspect as a third party. They don't have that. There has to be - to start with, there has to be motive. And they have - don't have that. They have a tortured argument that somehow because Faye Resnick may have had a minor drug habit that would cause and warrant some Colombian drug lord to come murder her friend and someone who is coming by her house at the time.
…
The defense would try to get into speculation, based upon speculation by trying to argue that there's more than one murderer and therefore if there's more than one murder, maybe that was the drug seller. And even though we don't have the name of a person, because Faye Resnick may have had a drug habit, it's likely to believe it was a drug seller. It's really ridiculous, your honor, there's too many inferences and too much speculation. It doesn't - none of this evidence in the entire trial warrants finding that there's evidence actually linking anybody other than the defendant, Orenthal James Simpson, to these murders. It is just not there. No matter how much Mr. Cochran and the other defense team members would try and weave that spin in front of the jury, it just does not survive. There is just not evidence there and the case law is clear.
…
There is no evidence of - that anybody had any will toward her because of that drug habit, anybody who was likely to murder her. There's no evidence of any drug seller that had threatened her or had - to whom she owed money - that was in town that night, that was anywhere near the premises. There is simply nothing even to link up that motive. And even if you had that link that might link up the motive, you don't have the evidence of actual perpetration. All of that is still speculation. There's still no evidence actually linking such a hypothetical person to it being the murderer and the person who killed those two innocent victims.
(In the following segment, witness Howard Bingham testifies about being on the same flight with Simpson from Los Angeles to Chicago:)
DEFENSE ATTORNEY JOHNNIE COCHRAN JR.: Mr. Bingham, sir, what is your occupation?
BINGHAM: I am a photographer.
COCHRAN: And you are a world renowned photographer?
BINGHAM: The world's greatest.
COCHRAN: All right. Just so we're clear about that, have you recently published a "30 Year Journey of Howard Bingham," your own personal book (inaudible)?
BINGHAM: Yes I did, on Muhammad Ali.
COCHRAN: You have an acquaintance with a man, Muhammad Ali?
BINGHAM: Yes, I do.
COCHRAN: What about that acquaintance? How long have you known him?
BINGHAM: I've known Ali since 1962. I've been all over the world with him and some say he's my best friend, talk to him all the time, every day, just left him night before last, had to come here.
…
COCHRAN: Good, thank you very much for coming. Sir, are you acquainted with the gentleman over here, Mr. O.J. Simpson?
BINGHAM: Yes, I am.
COCHRAN: And about how long have you known Mr. Simpson?
BINGHAM: I have been seeing and knowing him ever since about 1968 when he was with - when he was at USC.
COCHRAN: And so you came to know him there. Did you ever take pictures at the time?
BINGHAM: Yes, that's how I met him. I'm a photographer and I was at the games and in the locker rooms and just taking pictures at the games here and there.
COCHRAN: All right. And as such, would you say that he's - he's an acquaintance of yours, somebody you've known over the years?
BINGHAM: Yes, sir.
…
COCHRAN: What did you say to him, if anything?
BINGHAM: I just walked up there and tapped him on the shoulder. He looked around at me and said, "Hey, Bingham, how ya doin'?"
COCHRAN: All right. Did you have any further conversation?
BINGHAM: Yes, I did. I was asking him where was he going and so he asked me where was I going and so I - I told him I was going to Chicago.
COCHRAN: All right. How long did your conversation last with Mr. Simpson?
BINGHAM: A minute or so. After that, the hostess had asked me to go back to my seat because we was about to leave.
COCHRAN: Plane was about to take off?
BINGHAM: Yes, plane was about to take off.
COCHRAN: During this conversation that you had with Mr. Simpson, did you have occasion to - to look at him and look at his demeanor, how he appeared?
BINGHAM: Yes.
COCHRAN: Could you describe for this court and jury how Mr. Simpson appeared to you at that time, how did he seem?
BINGHAM: He seemed like the old O.J. that I always see here and there. I see him all over, East Coast, New York, Florida, all over all the time with Ali sometimes and sometimes on my own because I'm all over.
COCHRAN: All right. Did he -
BINGHAM: For ballgames.
COCHRAN: All right. Did he seem relaxed to you?
BINGHAM: He did.
 
 (In the following segment Bingham is cross-examined about why he flew in a coach seat when he normally flies first-class:)
PROSECUTOR MARCIA CLARK: How did that happen?
BINGHAM: What?
CLARK: That they put you in coach?
BINGHAM: What happened was it was at night and so I had a whole row and so I just went to sleep.
CLARK: So that was OK?
BINGHAM: It was for me because I rested.
CLARK: OK.
BINGHAM: But I had a lot of phone calls that next afternoon - that next morning that I was on the opening statements that said, "Bingham, you're cheap."
CLARK: World class photographer sitting in coach, is that right?
ITO: The world's greatest.
BINGHAM: Right, I'm sorry. You're a smart man, judge.
(In the following segment, Darden asks Heidstra if he heard Simpson's voice while walking his dog the night of the murders:)
DARDEN: You never heard Mr. Simpson's voice prior to June 12, 1994?
HEIDSTRA: No, never.
DARDEN: But you watch a lot of television, don't you?
HEIDSTRA: Some sports.
DARDEN: You watch the news?
HEIDSTRA: Yeah.
DARDEN: And have - and you watched sports over the years, is that right?
HEIDSTRA: Yeah.
DARDEN: What are your favorite sports?
HEIDSTRA: Soccer, what we call football in Europe.
DARDEN: Anything else?
HEIDSTRA: Oh, yeah, ice hockey, basketball.
DARDEN: American football?
HEIDSTRA: Boring.
ITO: Wait till you see baseball.
HEIDSTRA: You're right.
DARDEN: Over the years, have you watched Hertz commercials?
HEIDSTRA: No.
DARDEN: Have you ever seen any infomercials on television?
HEIDSTRA: Not that I remember. I'm not interested in that.
DARDEN: So your testimony is that you've never heard the defendant's voice prior to June 12, 1994?
HEIDSTRA: No, I never watched football, so it doesn't interest me.
DARDEN: Have - have you ever heard the defendant's voice on anything else?
HEIDSTRA: Maybe - maybe it was once. Maybe a Hertz - maybe a Hertz commercial I might have heard one time or something.
DARDEN: Well, do you recall that those commercials involving the defendant for Hertz used to run rather often, correct?
HEIDSTRA: Yeah.
DARDEN: They were everywhere?
HEIDSTRA: Two or three times, I don't remember.
DARDEN: And the defendant would talk in those commercials, do you remember that?
HEIDSTRA: Yeah, I remember.
DARDEN: And you can recognize the defendant's voice if you hear it, can't you?
HEIDSTRA: Yeah I can recognize (inaudible) probably - probably.
MR. DARDEN: May I proceed, your honor?
ITO: Proceed.
DARDEN: You recognized the voice you heard, the second voice, as the defendant's voice, didn't you?
HEIDSTRA: The second voice I heard in that - that alley?
DARDEN: Yes, the voice of the older man, the very angry voice?
HEIDSTRA: No, could not recognize it, there was too much noise with the dogs, how could I recognize the voice? I don't know the man.
DARDEN: Mr. Heidstra, didn't you tell Patricia Baret that the voice that you heard was the voice of the defendant's?
HEIDSTRA: Never, ever said that.
DARDEN: Didn't you tell Patricia Baret, quote, I know it was O.J., it had to be him, unquote?
HEIDSTRA: Never said that - absurd, absurd.
 
 (In the following segment, Heidstra testifies that he had an unpleasant interview with Darden:)
DARDEN: And isn't it true, Mr. Heidstra, that after you realized that you wouldn't be called by the prosecution, that you decided that you would do whatever you could to make sure you were called by the defense in this case?
HEIDSTRA: Not at all. Not at all.
DARDEN: Well, after I had visited you on May 29, 1995?
HEIDSTRA: Yes.
DARDEN: You telephoned the defense, didn't you?
HEIDSTRA: Sure. Yes.
DARDEN: And you told the defense that I had been there?
HEIDSTRA: Sure.
DARDEN: And you told the defense you didn't like me very much?
HEIDSTRA: You were not very pleasant with me.
DARDEN: Can I use that word, your honor?
ITO: Unpleasant?
CLARK: No, the word.
DARDEN: The other word?
ITO: Yes, you may.
DARDEN: You told the defense that you weren't impressed with me?
HEIDSTRA: Not impressed. You were not very pleasant - very cruel with me.
DARDEN: You told the defense that I was an asshole?
COCHRAN: (Inaudible.)
ITO: Yes.
DARDEN: Well, why did you tell -
ITO: Hold on. Why don't you confer with Mr. Cochran for a moment?
DARDEN: Thank you, your witness, I apologize … Your witness.
ITO: Mr. Darden.
DARDEN: Yes. Did you tell Patricia Baret that you thought I was an asshole?
HEIDSTRA: Never - never said that at all.
DARDEN: Did you tell Patricia Baret that you were going to come here and testify?
HEIDSTRA: Do you want me to answer?
DARDEN: - as a witness subpoenaed by the defense?
HEIDSTRA: Yes.
DARDEN: And you were going to help the defendant by your testimony?
HEIDSTRA: Give my testimony. I didn't say how. But I just give the truth what I know.
DARDEN: And you told Ms. Baret that you expected the defendant to show you his appreciation, didn't you?
HEIDSTRA: Not at all. I was on their side, so I guess they would appreciate that I was on their side.
DARDEN: I'm sorry, could you repeat that answer.
HEIDSTRA: I believe that they appreciated that I was on their side, that I testified for them.
DARDEN: Didn't you tell Ms. Baret that he, O.J. Simpson, is going to kiss you when you get out of prison?
HEIDSTRA: I don't know where she gets this from, that's absurd.
(In the following segment, Heidstra denies making statements about voice and race and making money off his story:)
COCHRAN: Is there any doubt in your mind that when you were on your street, on Dorothy, and you looked back before you saw this car turning right to go south on Bundy that it was about 10:45 in the evening?
HEIDSTRA: Around 45, yes.
COCHRAN: Any doubt in your mind about that?
HEIDSTRA: Must have been at that time exactly when I came to (Inaudible).
COCHRAN: Is there any doubt in your mind that you could not identify the voices of either one of these two people?
HEIDSTRA: Never, never could (Inaudible).
COCHRAN: And is it part of your vocabulary to identify the race and ethnicity of any particular voice, do you do that?
HEIDSTRA: No, that's absurd, that's crazy.
DARDEN: Objection.
ITO: Overruled.
HEIDSTRA: That's crazy, of course not.
COCHRAN: Have you ever done that?
HEIDSTRA: No.
COCHRAN: Would you do that?
HEIDSTRA: No I haven't - no, no, never in my mind.
COCHRAN: Did you do that in this case?
HEIDSTRA: No.
COCHRAN: Do you even know what O.J. Simpson sounds like?
HEIDSTRA: I heard maybe once or twice on TV, but never, I don't know the voice at all.
COCHRAN: Never heard his voice that night, did you?
HEIDSTRA: No, no, I don't know, it was too much noise.
DARDEN: Objection, your honor speculation.
ITO: Overruled.
COCHRAN: And you never saw him that night, did you?
HEIDSTRA: Never, saw nobody.
COCHRAN: Did you tell us the truth here today?
HEIDSTRA: I told you the truth.
COCHRAN: And even with regard to this man who is - supposedly has a cable TV show, he asked you to be on his TV show, did he?
HEIDSTRA: Yes.
COCHRAN: Did you turn him down, also?
HEIDSTRA: I turned him down.
COCHRAN: Did you turn everybody down about being on their show?
HEIDSTRA: I turned them all down, yes.
COCHRAN: Except to news - news broadcasts?
HEIDSTRA: News, yes.
COCHRAN: Now, have you been offered - did someone offer you to go on "Hard Copy"?
HEIDSTRA: Yeah, there was a lady, a friend of -
COCHRAN: Did a lady ask you to go on "Hard Copy" with some other person?
DARDEN: Objection, your honor, this is leading, irrelevant and -
ITO: Overruled.
HEIDSTRA: Yes.
COCHRAN: Who was that person that asked you to go on "Hard Copy" with her?
HEIDSTRA: That was Patricia.
COCHRAN: Patricia Baret?
HEIDSTRA: Yeah.
COCHRAN: Did you go on "Hard Copy" with Patricia Baret?
HEIDSTRA: No, I refused.
COCHRAN: You did what?
HEIDSTRA: I refused. I didn't want to do it.
COCHRAN: Did you take any money from anybody?
HEIDSTRA: No, no, no, nothing.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY ROBERT SHAPIRO: What did you see Mr. Simpson do at that point in time?
NORRIS: He put a bag over his shoulder and had a bag in his hand and he remembered to give Mike an autograph.
SHAPIRO: Did you see him sign the autograph to Mike?
NORRIS: Yes.
SHAPIRO: Did you have - can you tell us how Mr. Simpson appeared during the period of time that you saw him?
NORRIS: He just appeared like, you know, nonchalant just like he was, you know, going to leave on a flight.
SHAPIRO: How did he look to you? Can you describe that to the jury?
NORRIS: He looked natural. He was dressed real nice. You know, had on a stone washed type denim outfit, you know, trying to look kind of young, you know, just - I mean, he was just, you know, tryin' to be cool, you know.
SHAPIRO: And would you describe his demeanor to the jury?
NORRIS: He just - I mean - he just was like smooth, just, you know, hey, just walkin' through like "I'm O.J."
