Classic cars are appealing to auto enthusiasts throughout the world. Stamps depicting such cars likewise have been favorites for philatelists over the years.
Revving up the engines is the Bailiwick of Guernsey, a group of islands in the English Channel, which commemorates the centenary of its first car with a set of five stamps. The colorful adhesives feature venerable vehicles which have graced the island's roads for 100 years.
The 16 pence depicts the 1894 Peugot, Type 3, referred to as the Petrolier. It was owned by Major A. Thom, a Guernseyman living in Switzerland. The Peugot was capable of speeds of only 12 miles per hour.
The 24 p illustrates the 1903 Mercedes Simplex which had great speeds of up to 60 mph. The 35 p pictures the 1906 Humber, a four cylinder touring car, considered most stylish at that time.
The 41 p displays the 1936 Bentley sports car (4 liter) which could reach speeds of up to 90 mph. The 60 p has a view of the 1948 MG (Morris Garages). The MG Midget was introduced in 1945 and became popular in the U.S. where it sparked a sports car boom that led to such models as the Chevrolet Corvette.

Stained Glass & Tribal Art
"Art" on stamps is another popular subject for topical collectors. Today we report on two different and diverse art objects - religious stained-glass windows and tribal arts and crafts.
France has released a special stamp illustrating a view of the Romanesque stained-glass windows at St. Julian Cathedral in Le Mans. The five paneled windows relate to the legend of St. Stephen, one of the earliest Christian martyrs. Each of the windows shows a scene from his martyrdom and finally his resurrection.
The French stamps are available from your local stamp dealer.
In the West African nation of Ghana, a set of 10 stamps and two souvenir sheets has been issued featuring that country's arts and crafts.
Portrayed on the stamps are the following: a tribal pot and lid, traditional tribal doll, snake charmer figurine, colorful beads, a tribal scabbard, a hoe, a deer figurine, a tribal pipe, traditional tribal mask, and a traditional doll figure.

Discoveries of Europe
European Discoveries is the theme chosen by San Marino for its 1994 "Europa" set. San Marino, the oldest independent country in Europe, has released a pair of stamps featuring the journey of the "Ulysses" spacecraft of the European Space Agency.
It was launched in 1990 by the space shuttle "Discovery" with the aim of flying over the poles of the sun to explore the sun's environment for the first time. In September 1994, the "Ulysses" will continue over the South Polar Pass and in September of next year will conclude its journey. The flight is a joint venture of the European Space Agency and NASA.
