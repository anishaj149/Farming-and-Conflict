In Johannesburg, ANC officials said they would have no comment.
According to The Sunday Times, the couple will separate but no divorce is planned.
Mandela, 73, was released two years ago after serving 27 years in prison for trying to overthrow the white government. He married Mrs. Mandela, 57, in 1958 and they had two children before he went to prison.
During his incarceration, Mrs. Mandela was banned by the government, placed under house arrest and jailed.
Last year, she and two others were convicted of kidnapping and assault in the 1988 death of Stompie Seipei, a 14-year-old boy. She was sentenced to six years in prison but freed on bail pending an appeal.
The Sunday Times said one of her co-defendants, Xoliswa Falati, recently told ANC officials she lied at the trial to protect Mrs. Mandela. The newspaper said Mrs. Falati now accuses Mrs. Mandela of ordering the assault on Seipei and operating "hit squads" in the Soweto black township.
News reports in South Africa last week said Mrs. Falati had been living at the Mandela house in Soweto but was moved away after a dispute with Mrs. Mandela.
