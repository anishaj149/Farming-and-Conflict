"Masters of the Ring" - a philatelic tribute to world famous professional boxing champions - will capture the excitement and jog the memories of sports fans from all corners of the globe.
The new set has been released by Sierra Leone in West Africa. There are eight different 200 LE vertical stamps featuring such illustrious champs from Joe Louis to Evander Holyfield (who recently lost his heavyweight crown to Riddick Bowe).
The sheetlet is accompanied by a special 1000 LE souvenir sheet honoring the great champion Muhammad Ali. Depicted are Archie Moore, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard plus Holyfield and Louis.
The stamps were originally scheduled for release last September to coincide with the centennial of the historical match between challenger James J. Corbett and the world heavyweight champion John L. Sullivan. But there were printing delays and the issuance was last month.
Continuing on the pugilistic front, Sierra Leone also released a sheetlet of eight stamps illustrating scenes from some of the great boxing movies.
Shown on the stamps are: Wallace Berry in a scene from the 1931 film "The Champ," William Holden in the 1939 movie "Golden Boy," John Garfield in the 1947 opus "Body and Soul," Kirk Douglas in the 1949 film "Champion," Robert Ryan in the 1949 motion picture "The Set-Up," Anthony Quinn in the 1962 drama "Requiem for a Heavyweight," Elvis Presley in the 1962 flick "Kid Galahad," and Jeff Bridges in the 1972 picture "Fat City."
For the Sierra Leone salute to boxing, write Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corp., 460 W. 34th St., New York City 10001.

Finland & Arctic Foxes
Finland has issued four new stamps featuring Arctic foxes. The purpose of the stamps is to promote the protection of nature and the environment as well as publicize the work of the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature).
The Arctic fox belongs to the endangered species of Finland. Two stamps show the Arctic fox in his summer coat and the other two stamps depict the Arctic fox in his winter coat.
The Arctic foxes are the theme of a set of four maximum cards sold at the same time as the stamps, according to the Posts and Telecommunications Department of Finland.

San Marino & Television
San Marino has issued an unusual souvenir sheet to mark the inauguration of its state television.
One of the stamps is a hologram which symbolizes a satellite in a starry sky. Another stamp features the finish line of the 100 meters at the Athletics World Championships as captured on TV. Six athletes broke the 10 seconds barrier in Tokyo in 1991.
The third stamp portrays Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon in 1969, as shown on television. The central stamp bears the hologram in the sky over San Marino City.
