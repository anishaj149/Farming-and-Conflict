Thumbnail sketches of the leading runners in Monday's Boston Marathon:
 
 MEN
IBRAHIM HUSSEIN, 34, Kenya - The two-time defending champion and three-time winner is coming off his personal best, 2 hours, 8 minutes, 14 seconds, at the 1992 Boston Marathon. His first Boston victory, in 1988, was the closest finish in the race's history, as he beat Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania by one second. He also ran Boston in 1989, finishing fourth, and 1990, failing to finish because of leg and foot injuries. Hussein also has won the 1987 New York City Marathon and the Honolulu Marathon three times (1985-87). His biggest disappointment was placing 37th in the 1992 Olympic Games. He will be trying to become only the fourth runner to win the Boston Marathon at least four times, joining Clarence DeMar, with seven victories, and Gerard Cote and Bill Rodgers, with four apiece.
JUMA IKANGAA, 33, Tanzania - He is history's most consistent marathoner - and perhaps one of the sport's most hard-luck runners. He is the only marathoner to break 2:09:00 six times and 2:10:00 eight times, yet he never has won Boston nor come close in the Olympic Games. At Boston, he finished second three consecutive times, including his one-second defeat by Hussein five years ago, and was fourth last year. And in the Olympics, he was seventh in 1988 and 34th last year. His career best is 2:08:01 in winning the New York City Marathon in 1989.
HIROMI TANIGUCHI, 33, Japan - He was the world's top-ranked marathoner for 1991, after winning the world championship marathon in the blistering heat at Tokyo and placing ninth in the Tokyo Marathon. But he couldn't cope as well with the warm conditions at Barcelona last year, placing eighth in the Olympic Games. He also has won the Tokyo Marathon in 1989, the Hokkaido (Japan) Marathon in 1989 and the Rotterdam Marathon in 1990. However, his fastest time (2:07:40) came in finishing second in the 1988 Beijing Marathon. This is his Boston debut.
DAVID TSEBE, 26, South Africa - The fastest of the rapidly emerging South Africans, he posted the fastest time in the world last year, winning the Berlin Marathon in 2:08:07. With his country having been barred from international competition for more than 20 years until 1992 because of its apartheid policies, he and three other South Africans will be running Boston for the first time. Tsebe tried to skirt the ban by running the 1989 Honolulu Marathon under an assumed name and with a false passport, but was caught. After that, he won four marathons in his country, including the 1990 South African Championships, and was runner-up at the 1991 South African Championships.
STEVE JONES, 37, Wales - The former world record-holder and world's top-ranked marathoner has regained new confidence after winning the 1992 Toronto Marathon in 2:10:06, his first victory since taking the 1988 New York City Marathon in 2:08:20. Adding to his relaxed mental state is the fact that he already has been selected to represent England in this year's World Championships at Stuttgart, Germany, in August. Jones also has won the 1984 and 1985 Chicago Marathons and the 1985 London Marathon, but he has yet to win Boston. His best Boston finish was second in 1987. Jones set the world record of 2:08:05 in winning at Chicago in 1984, then lowered that time to 2:07:13 the following year at Chicago, missing by one second the world record then held by Portugal's Carlos Lopes.
STEPHEN FREIGANG, 25, Germany - A rapidly rising, young marathoner, he proved he belongs among the elite by winning the bronze medal at the 1992 Olympics and being ranked third in the world for the year. Also in 1992, Freigang won the Berlin Half-Marathon in a quick 1:01:14. He placed fourth in the 1990 Berlin Marathon in a career-best 2:09:45 and set a meet record by winning the 1991 World Student Games 10,000 meters in 28:15.84.
STEVE SPENCE, 30, Chambersburg, Pa. - The hard-working Spence has been the top-ranked U.S. marathoner for each of the past three years. He earned the honor for last year by winning the U.S. Olympic trials, then placing 12th at the Barcelona Games. He burst into international prominence in 1991 by finishing third at the World Championships, becoming the first American male marathoner to win a medal in a major championship since Frank Shorter got the silver at the 1976 Olympics. He also won the U.S. marathon championship in 1990 in a career-best 2:12:17 and holds U.S. road records for 12 kilometers and 15 kilometers.
KIM-JAE-YONG, 26, South Korea - He is the first Korean to run the Boston Marathon since 1950 when Kee Yong Ham won and led a sweep of the first three places by his countrymen. Kim won the Seoul Marathon last year for the second straight time, recording his best clocking, 2:09:30. He also placed 10th at the Barcelona Olympics and finished sixth at the 1991 Fukuoka (Japan) Marathon.
BONIFACE MERANDE, 30, Kenya - He chased Hussein for several miles in last year's Boston Marathon before tiring and finishing sixth in his marathon debut. The result earned him a place on the Kenyan Olympic team and he placed 14th at Barcelona. Merande also represented Kenya at the 1988 Olympics and was a finalist in the 10,000 meters. He also finished fourth at the 1988 World Cross Country Championships.
ANDRES, Espinosa, 30, Mexico - A late bloomer in the marathon, Espinosa did not begin competing internationally until 1990, when he led the San Francisco Marathon for 24 miles before finishing second. The following year, he was runner-up in the New York City Marathon in an impressive 2:10:00. He continued his consistent performances last year with a third-place at Boston and a second again at New York.
JOHNNY KELLEY, 85, East Dennis, Mass. - An institution of the Boston Marathon, he has started the race an amazing 61 times and completed 58. This time, Kelley will not run the entire course, but nevertheless will be one of the most popular figures along the route. Kelley won the race twice, in 1935 and 1945, and was second seven times. Having run his first Boston Marathon in 1928, Kelley has competed in the race during eight decades.
JOAN BENOIT SAMUELSON, 35, Freeport, Maine - She has endured moments of greatness and moments of pain during her marvelous career. The highlight was winning the first Olympic women's marathon in 1984 in 2:24:52. To qualify for the U.S. team, she won the Olympic trials only 17 days after undergoing arthroscopic surgery. She has won Boston twice, in 1979 and in 1983 in a then-world record 2:22:43. The time still stands as the women's course record at Boston, but Samuelson lowered her American record to 2:21:21 in winning the 1985 Chicago Marathon. Since then, her best time was 2:26:54 in placing fourth at Boston in 1991. Last year, Samuelson won the Columbus (Ohio) Marathon in 2:32:18 and the Maine Half Marathon in 1:16:54. Various injuries have plagued her in recent years, and kept her from running in the 1988 and 1992 Olympic Games.
OLGA MARKOVA, 24, Russia - Although she won the 1992 Boston Marathon in 2:23,43, the fastest of the year and the second-best ever by a woman at Boston, she did not compete for the Unified Team at the Barcelona Olympics because she skipped the team qualifier at Los Angeles. That disappointment aside, Markova was the runner-up at the New York City Marathon for the second year in a row and was ranked No. 3 in the world for 1992. Markova made her mark on the international scene by winning the 1990 Marines Corps Marathon in her first race in the United States. She also was third at the 1991 Los Angeles Marathon.
WANDA PANFIL, 33, Poland - The 1991 world champion and the 1991 Boston Marathon winner in a swift 2:24:18, Panfil will be trying to regain her Boston title. Last year, she failed to successfully defend, finishing sixth in a respectable 2:29:29. She also will be seeking to regain the No. 1 world ranking she held in 1991. Panfil began her rise toward the top by finishing second at the 1989 London Marathon in 2:27:05, winning the 1990 Nagoya (Japan) Marathon in 2:31:04, winning the 1990 London Marathon in 2:26:31, winning the 1990 Goodwill Games 10,000-meter race in 32:01.17 and winning the 1990 New York City Marathon in 2:30:45. She is married to Mexican Olympian Mauricio Gonzalez.
VALENTINA EGOROVA, 29, Russia - Winner of the 1992 Olympic gold medal in 2:32:41, she finished the year ranked No. 1 in the world. She also placed fourth at the Los Angeles Marathon (2:29:41) and the Tokyo International Women's Marathon (2:31:27) last year. Egorova set her personal best of 2:28:18 while finishing third at the 1991 London Marathon. She also has finished second at the 1990 Osaka (Japan) International Women's Marathon, the 1990 European Championships and the 1991 Tokyo International Women's Marathon.
KIM JONES, 34, Spokane, Wash. - She is trying to come back after an ankle injury forced her early withdrawal from last year's U.S. Olympic trials, a race in which she was the favorite. She also missed making the 1988 Olympic team, placing fifth at the trials. Jones was the top-ranked U.S. marathoner in 1986, 1989 and 1991. In 1989, she had a remarkable season, running four marathons in 11 months, including two only a month apart. And all were quality performances. She began by finishing second in the Houston Marathon in 2:32:31. She followed that with a third at Boston in April in 2:29:34, a victory in the Twin Cities Marathon in October in 2:32:42 and a second at New York in November in 2:27:54. The following year, she was fifth in the Boston Marathon and second at New York, and in 1991, Jones placed second at Berlin and was third at Boston in 2:26:40, a career-best.
LISA WEIDENBACH, 31, Gig Harbor, Wash. - Although she has several marathon victories, including Boston in 1985, Weidenbach is most noted for her three fourth-place finishes at the U.S. Olympic trials in 1984, 1988 and 1992. In addition to her Boston victory, Weidenbach has won marathons at Montreal (1984), Chicago (1988-89) and Hokkaido (1990), where she recorded her best time (2:28:15). She enjoys running Boston, also having placed 10th in 1987 and fifth in 1989. She was a former All-American swimmer at Michiagn and competed in the U.S. Olympic swimming trials in 1980.
