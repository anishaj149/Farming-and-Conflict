Movies with themes based on various stories concerning World War II have captured the imagination and interest of film fans throughout the world for the past 50 years.
A tribute to these wartime favorites is the subject for a special commemorative stamp issue by the West African nation of Sierra Leone. The series consists of 12 stamps and three souvenir sheets, and is part of a global 50-year remembrance of World War II.
The 2 le features Audie Murphy in the 1955 film "To Hell and Back." It told the story of Murphy, the most decorated soldier of the war, who portrayed himself in this autobiographical picture.
The 5 le depicts Jack Palance in the 1956 cinema "Attack." The 10 le illustrates Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon in the 1938 production of "Mrs. Miniver." The 20 le shows an illustration from the 1961 film "The Guns of Navarone" which starred Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn and David Niven.
The 30 le has a scene from the 1940 movie "The Great Dictator" starring Charlie Chaplin. The 50 le features a train in motion from the 1964 adventure motion picture "The Train" which had a magnificent cast headed by Burt Lancaster. The 60 le depicts a pen atop blank pages of a diary from the 1959 film "Diary of Anne Frank."
The 80 le portrays William Holden in a scene from the 1957 picture "The Bridge on the River Kwai." The 100 le illustrates a scene from the 1944 film "Lifeboat" directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Tallulah Bankhead.
The 200 le features John Wayne in one of his most memorable roles in the 1949 "Sands of Iwo Jima." The 300 le shows Van Johnson and Spencer Tracy in the 1944 production of "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." The 350 le depicts Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the popular classic "Casablanca" released in 1942.
One souvenir sheet shows George C. Scott in a scene from the 1970 movie "Patton." The second sheet shows Gregory Peck in the 1949 picture "Twelve O'Clock High." The third is an illustration from the 1970 film "Tora! Tora! Tora!"
Collectors interested in acquiring these stamps may write to the Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corp., 460 West 34th St., New York City 10001. The cost is $ 9.75 for the set of 12 stamps or $ 10.75 for the set of three special souvenir sheets. For the 12 stamps plus the three sheets the price is $ 15.00.

When U.N. Stamps Are Valid as Postage
Several readers have requested information on U.N. stamps. For mailing purposes, United Nations stamps in U.S. denominations are valid for postage only if mailed at U.N. Headquarters in New York.
Most people who order U.N. stamps, however, do so for their collections. U.N. stamps are on sale at face value and can be purchased by sending a personal check or money order (in U.S. dollars) payable to the United Nations Postal Administration. Further information may be obtained by writing the UNPA, PO Box 5900, Grand Central Station, New York City, 10163-9992.

Postmark Collectors Get a Break
Collectors who specialize in U.S. postmarks now will have up to 30 days following the date of the postmark to make their orders. In the past, mail order requests had to be received at local post offices on or before the pictorial postmark date to receive service.
Pictorial postmarks are provided by local post offices to commemorate local events being celebrated in communities throughout the nation. People attending these events could obtain the postmark in person at the temporary post office station established at the event.
Those who cannot attend may now submit a mail order request to the postmaster in the appropriate city up to 30 days after the date of cancellation.
