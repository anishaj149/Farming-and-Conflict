Iraq is demanding progress toward solving the Palestinian problem to accompany its possible concessions on Kuwait. The following are some facts and figures about the Palestinians.
 
 WHO THEY ARE:
The Palestinians are Arabs or descendants of Arabs who lived in the territory of mandatory Palestine until the end of the British mandate in 1948 and became dispersed throughout the Middle East and other countries as a result of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948-1949.
It has been estimated that over 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven out of what is now Israel in that period.
Most Palestinians are Moslems but some are Christians belonging to various denominations.
 
 NUMBERS:
About 1.7 million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
Of the one million Palestinians in the West Bank, at least 374,000 reside in 20 refugee camps. Of the 700,000 Palestinians in Gaza, 450,000 are refugees living in 8 refugee camps.
Some 843,000 Palestinians, or the so-called "Israeli Arabs," live within Israel's pre-1967 borders.
Estimates of the numbers of Palestinians living in diaspora vary from over 4 million to 5.8 million. Between 1 million and 1.7 million live in Jordan, 270,000 to 350,000 in Lebanon, about 225,000 to 260,000 in Syria, and others in Persian Gulf states and the rest of the world.
 
 WHAT THEY SEEK:
The Palestinians have waged a revolt against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza since December 1987, demanding an independent state in these areas with Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem as its capital.
Israel has offered the Palestinians negotiations on limited autonomy in the two areas. It says unified Jerusalem is its eternal capital.
Efforts to start peace talks have broken down because Israel refuses to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which most Palestinians support as their sole legitimate representative.
The PLO, for most of its existence, demanded the destruction of Israel and the return of all Palestinians to their homeland. But in 1988 the PLO's parliament-in-exile, the Palestine National Council, accepted U.N. resolutions that implicitly recognize Israel.
Some radical PLO factions and the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas group, which is considered to be a rising force in the West Bank and Gaza, reject this view.
Israeli officials have expressed skepticism about the Palestinians' acceptance of a so-called "two-state" solution. The country is split over the issue, with the hard-liners seeking to keep the occupied areas and the left-wing camp ready to trade territory for peace.
 
 UPRISING IN NUMBERS:
During the Palestinian uprising, at least 792 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians. An additional 325 have been slain by fellow Arabs on suspicion of assisting Israel. Fifty-seven Israelis have died in the violence.
