Postal officials of the Grenada Grenadines, a dependency of the Caribbean island nation of Grenada, have released a series of eight stamps and two souvenir sheets that hail model toy trains made by early American toy companies.
The 15-cent shows No. 2220 Switcher locomotive made by Voltamp Electric Co., circa 1910. The 50-cent depicts the 0-4-0 engine of the Bridge Port Line made by American Miniature Railroad Co. in 1907. The 50-cent pictures the first electric toy locomotive made by the Ives Co., in 1910. The 75-cent illustrates the J.C. Penny Special No. 4753 made by American Flyer in the 1920s.
The $ 1 features the cast metal locomotive made by Hafner in 1916. The $ 2 has the copper-plated cast iron locomotive and tender floor model pull toy by Hubley in 1900. The $ 5 portrays the No. 3245 long cab locomotive of the Olympian set by the Ives Co. in 1929.
The first of the two $ 6 souvenir sheets features the Tom Thumb Railroad O-Gauge electric model of lithographed, stamped steel made by Hoge Mfg. Co. in 1931. The second sheet depicts the American Flyer passenger train set, The Statesman.

World War II Stamps Popular
Collectors of stamps dedicated to World War II have had over 50 years worth of items for their treasuries.
World War II stamps have been issued almost from the beginning in 1939. Even before the United States entered the conflict in 1941, a National Defense issue was released in 1940 to promote preparedness in industry, agriculture, Army and Navy, security, education, conservation and health.
The United States issued stamps honoring various branches of the armed services, citizens of overrun countries in Europe and Asia as well as for people working on the home front.
The Postal Service has led the way in creating World War II commemoratives. The format presents two horizontal strips of five sheetlets commemorating the events of the war.
Each year for five years a new sheetlet will be released. In 1992, the focus was on the many events that occurred in 1942. Your local post office or stamp dealer can provide you with all the stamps issued so far.

Philatelists looking for unusual topical ideas about past postal happenings may be interested in a handbook titled "United States Postal History Sampler" by Richard B. Graham, which contains 192 pages devoted to a wide array of postal history subjects.
The 15 individual chapters are selected to suggest the range of topics around which collections can be built. They include train wreck covers, dead letter office markings, fancy cancels, free franks, flag cancels, turn-of-the-century advertising covers and Navy ship post office markings.
The handbook combines text and illustrations to bring postal history to life showing new covers and postal markings can be just as fascinating as the stamps themselves.
