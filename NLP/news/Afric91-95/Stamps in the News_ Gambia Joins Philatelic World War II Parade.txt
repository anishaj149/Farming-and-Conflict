From l99l to 1995 countries throughout the world - including the U.S. - are scheduling - individual stamps, souvenir sheets and stamp sheetlets commemorating the 50th anniversary of World War II.
The illustrations highlight various events, battles, people and places connected with the conflict.
The West African nation of Gambia (a former British colony) has joined the philatelic war parade by issuing a souvenir sheet of 10 stamps depicting the Pacific theater of operations "From Pearl Harbor through the Battle of Midway." Each stamp is of 2 dalasy denomination.
Depicted are the following:
- The front page of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin bearing the ominous headline "WAR! OAHU BOMBED BY JAPANESE PLANES."
- The flash news bulletin sent to newspapers and other news organizations in the U.S. informing the nation of the devastating attack against American forces at Pearl Harbor.
- The beginning of the Japanese surprise attack at Pearl Harbor with the code words "Tora, Tora, Tora."
- The USS Pensylvania, the flagship of the U.S. fleet stationed at Pearl Harbor.
- The USS Ward sinking two Japanese midget submarines prior to the actual attack on Pearl Harbor.
- The Japanese strafing the Ford Naval Air Station at Pearl Harbor.
- The beginning of the Japanese invasion of the American island of Guam on Dec. 10.
- The turning of the tide with the recapture of Wake Island by U.S. forces in February 1942.
- The U.S. aerial attack on mainland Japan by American B-25 bombers from the carrier USS Hornet under the command of Col. Jimmy Doolittle.
- A U.S. aircraft attacking a Japanese carrier in the decisive Battle of Midway during June 1942. This sea and air victory was a turning point in the Pacific theater.
In the central portion of the Gambian souvenir sheet is an illustration of one of the few U.S. aircraft able to become airborne during the attack on Pearl Harbor.
If you are interested in the Gambian World War II sheet - which is similar in design to the souvenir sheets being issued every year until 1995 by the U.S. Postal Service, contact your local stamp dealer or write to the Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corp., 460 W. 34th St., New York, NY, 10001.
