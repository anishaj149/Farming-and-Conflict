Between the Sahara and the equator lies the Sahel, the cultural frontier of a continent, the war zone between African and Arab, Islam and Christianity, slave and slaver, black and white:
 
 ---
SENEGAL: Population 8 million. Light-skinned Mauritanians who dominated commerce were attacked in Senegal after a border dispute with Mauritania over grazing rights.
Senegal expelled tens of thousands of Mauritanians.
 
 ---
MAURITANIA: Population 2.1 million. White Moor government accused of oppressing black population through language restrictions, forced exile, torture and murder. Slavery banned in 1980, still practiced to some degree.
 
 ---
MALI: Population 8.5 million. Fighting a civil war with the Tuaregs, nomadic descendants of the ancient Berbers, since 1990. The Tuaregs contend their land, language and culture are being repressed by the black government.
 
 ---
NIGER: Population 8.3 million. Like Mali, fighting a rebellion against the nomadic Tuaregs. Most recent rebel attack was July 23, against a state-run oil depot in Agadez.
 
 ---
BURKINA FASO: Population 9.6 million. The arid north is home to about 25,000 Tuareg refugees fleeing fighting in Mali.
 
 ---
CHAD: Population 5.2 million. Has battled a Libya-financed rebellion and a border war since the 1970s. Libya seized northern Chad and held it until a government offensive drove the Libyans out in 1987.
 
 ---
GAMBIA: Population 900,000. The government of Gambia, a tiny former British colony on the Atlantic coast surrounded by Senegal, was toppled in July by a group of junior officers.
 
 ---
CAPE VERDE: Population 400,000. An Atlantic archipelago west of Senegal and once ruled by Portugal. People are mix of African and Portuguese.
 
 ---
SUDAN: Technically not part of the geographic region, but faces similar racial problems. Population 26.5 million. Scene of a brutal, decade-long civil war between the Arab north and the black Christian south. War, famine and refugee movements have left 1 million dead.
