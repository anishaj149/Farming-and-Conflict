An Egyptian explosives expert who trained with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Osama bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan is the new face of al-Qaida in Iraq, the U.S. military says.
Abu Ayyub al-Masri took over the cell after an American bomb killed al-Zarqawi last week, Maj. Gen. William Caldwell said, displaying a photograph of a bearded man in a traditional white Arab headdress.
The military spokesman said al-Masri was the man identified in an Internet posting by al-Qaida that said Abu Hamza al-Muhajer was al-Zarqawi's successor. The name, a nom de guerre, means "emigrant" in Arabic and suggested he was not an Iraqi.
However, U.S. National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said it's not certain that al-Masri is al-Zarqawi's successor.
"That's clearly one of the leading names, but we're going to need a little bit of time to sort out and they're clearly needing a little time to sort out where they go after what is clearly a big blow to al-Qaida," Hadley said at the White House.
Islamist watchers in Egypt expressed skepticism, saying they had never heard of al-Masri another alias that means "the Egyptian."
"His codename doesn't ring a bell for me; he's not one of the wanted Jihadis in Egypt," said Egyptian lawyer Montasser el-Zayat, who was imprisoned with al-Qaida No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahri from 1981-84.
According to the military, Al-Masri was a founding member of al-Qaida in Iraq. After meeting the Jordanian-born al-Zarqawi in Afghanistan, he followed him to Iraq to help set up the terror cell in 2003.
Even before terror leader's death, the Bush administration posted a $200,000 bounty on al-Masri because of his level of leadership within al-Qaida, Caldwell said.
Citing recently declassified documents, he said al-Masri has been a terrorist since 1982, "beginning with his involvement in the Egyptian Islamic Jihad," which was led by al-Zawahri, bin Laden's top deputy.
Going by that chronology, the photograph the military presented showing a young man with a sparse mustache and a trimmed goatee appeared to be at least several years old.
The beard as well as the headdress white cloth with a black coil are more often associated with men from the Gulf states than Egypt, where Western-style clothing is common, such headdresses are generally not used, and beards fuller when worn.
Caldwell said the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency provided the picture.
The new leader issued a Web statement Tuesday vowing to avenge al-Zarqawi's death and threatening horrific attacks "in the coming days."
"Don't be overcome with joy about killing our sheik Abu Musab (al-Zarqawi), God bless his soul, because he has left lions behind him," the statement said.
Citing recently declassified information, Caldwell said the military believes al-Masri first went to Afghanistan in 1999 to receive training and lecture on Islam to other militants. There he became an expert in building roadside bombs, skills he used in Fallujah and Baghdad.
He trained with al-Zarqawi at the al-Farouq camp in Afghanistan and they began to collaborate in Iraq. Raids in April and May in southern Baghdad recovered material confirming his high-level involvement in moving foreign fighters from Syria to Iraq, Caldwell said.
However, Yasser al-Sirri, an Egyptian who runs the Islamic Observation Center in London, said information supplied by al-Qaida in announcing the new leader pointed to another man: Abdullah bin Rashid al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Mujahedeen Shura Council five allied groups in the Sunni Arab-dominated insurgency.
"I'm 95 percent sure that this al-Masri doesn't exist," al-Sirri said, adding that the group could be trying to cover up the nationality of its new leader to promote a broader Islamic identity.
"Al-Qaida does not want to show that he is an Iraqi because they work under the Islamic banner ... and they seek international jihad," al-Sirri said.
Caldwell acknowledged that al-Masri's ability to exert leadership over al-Qaida cells remained unclear and said other "al-Qaida senior leadership members and Sunni terrorists" could try to take over the operations.
He pointed to al-Baghdadi along with Abu Abdul-Rahman al-Iraqi, whom al-Qaida in Iraq statements have identified as the group's deputy. Al-Iraqi was believed to have been killed in the airstrike along with al-Zarqawi.
Mustafa Alani, a terror expert at the Gulf Research Center, said the ultimate call for the new leader would be made by bin Laden or al-Zawahri, believed to be hiding in the rugged border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
