Robert Anderson
LOS ANGELES (AP) Robert Anderson, who as president, chairman and CEO of Rockwell International Corp. oversaw building of NASA's space shuttles and the Air Force's B-1B bomber, died Saturday. He was 85.
Anderson, who also spent 22 years at Chrysler Corp., died at home of complications from cancer, Rockwell spinoff Rockwell Collins Inc. said Tuesday.
Anderson served in top positions at Rockwell International when it was a multi-industry company that served as prime contractor for the space shuttles and builder of the B-1.
Anderson, a Rockwell director since 1968, became president and chief operating officer in 1970, and then chairman and chief executive officer in 1979. He retired in 1988 and became chairman emeritus in 1990.
During the peak of his tenure, company sales exceeded $10 billion and there were more than 125,000 employees in its aerospace, electronics, automotive, and general businesses, Rockwell Collins said.
But both of the company's high-profile aerospace products endured controversy.
The day the shuttle Challenger blew up during launch in 1986, Anderson said Rockwell was "shocked by the catastrophe" but that the company's scientists and engineers were making every effort to find the cause.
The B-1, a supersonic, swing-wing bomber designed to elude radar by flying at low altitudes to deliver nuclear warheads, was produced despite years of questions over whether it was needed, could perform as well as Rockwell and the Air Force promised, and its cost.
Rockwell International merged its businesses with other companies or spun them off starting in the mid-1990s, with much of its aerospace and defense business going to the Boeing Co. A final spinoff in 2001 formed Rockwell Automation and Rockwell Collins.
P.W. Botha
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) P.W. Botha, South Africa's last hard-line white president who led the country through its worst racial violence and deepest international isolation, died Tuesday, the South African Press Association reported. He was 90.
SAPA quoted security staff at his home on the southern Cape coast.
Nicknamed the "Old Crocodile" for his feared temper and sometimes ruthless manner, Botha served as head of the white racist government from 1978 to 1989. Throughout his leadership he resisted mounting pressure to release South Africa's most famous political prisoner, Nelson Mandela. Mandela was freed by Botha's successor, F.W. de Klerk in 1990.
Botha liked to depict himself as the first South African leader to pursue race reform, but he tenaciously defended the framework of apartheid, sharply restricting the activities of black political organizations and detaining more than 30,000 people.
Through a series of liberalizing moves, Botha sought support among the Asian and mixed-race communities by creating separate parliamentary chambers. He lifted restrictions on interracial sex and marriage. He met with Mandela during his last year as president.
But after each step forward, there was a backlash, resulting in the 1986 state of emergency declaration and the worst reprisals of more than four decades of apartheid.
Within a year after Botha stepped down, de Klerk released Mandela after 27 years in prison and put South Africa on the road to its first all-race elections in 1994, when Mandela became president.
In December 1997, Botha stubbornly resisted appearing before a panel investigating apartheid-era crimes. He risked criminal penalties by repeatedly defying subpoenas from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to testify about the State Security Council that he headed.
The council was believed to have sanctioned the killing and torture of anti-apartheid activists, and the panel wanted to know what Botha's involvement was.
Botha won election to Parliament in 1948, the year the National Party came to power and began codifying apartheid legislation. He joined the Cabinet in 1961 and became defense minister in 1966.
Jens Christian Hauge
OSLO, Norway (AP) Jens Christian Hauge, who led Norway's military underground in World War II and then became an influential politician and business leader, died Monday. He was 91.
Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg hailed Hauge as a "giant," and pledged a state funeral.
Hauge joined the military arm of the Norwegian resistance movement, called Milorg, after Nazi Germany invaded and occupied the Nordic nation in 1940.
He became the leader of the 40,000 underground fighters, heading a fight against the German occupation force that made him a national hero when it became known after the war.
In the postwar period, he served in Labor governments as defense minister and then justice minister.
He was partly responsible for Norway's joining NATO in 1949.
After he joined the resistance, he worked in secret and changed identities so often to escape the Nazis that not even the exiled Norwegian government, operating in England, knew what name he was using.
When Norway was liberated in May 1945, Hauge was given much of the credit for the peaceful transition back to Norwegian rule. The same year, at age 30, the Labor Party member was named Norway's youngest ever defense minister, a post he held until 1952. He also served briefly as Justice Minister in 1955.
Muhammadu Maccido
SOKOTO, Nigeria (AP) Muhammadu Maccido, the 19th sultan of Sokoto and spiritual leader to tens of millions of Nigerian Muslims, was killed Sunday when a Nigerian ADC airliner crashed shortly after takeoff in the capital, Abuja. He was 58.
An important voice of moderation and calm in Africa's most-populous nation, Maccido was among 96 people killed in the deadly crash. Thousands of people trooped to Maccido's palace in the northwestern city of Sokoto, where his body was buried Sunday.
President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian, was among those mourning the spiritual leader.
Maccido often spoke out in favor of peace in Nigeria, even as the country witnessed some of its worst bouts of sectarian violence.
Nigeria's 130 million people are roughly split between a predominantly Muslim north and Christian or animist south.
Thousands were killed as the imposition of strict Islamic law by 12 predominantly Islamic states in the north increased friction with Christians and other non-Muslims. Through the tensions, which flared with the end of strict military rule in 1999, Maccido urged peace among all religious groups.
When immunization of children against polio were boycotted by large numbers in northern Nigeria in 2003 over baseless allegations by radical Muslim preachers it was a ploy to sterilize people and spread AIDS, Maccido came out in support of the vaccine.
Vaccination programs resumed in 2004, but the boycott set back global eradication efforts, causing a polio outbreak that spread the disease across Africa and into the Middle East.
Maccido's official titles included leader of the faithful and head of the National Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs. He became the sultan in 1996, after his predecessor Ibrahim Dasuki was deposed by the then military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha.
Jack McGinley
PITTSBURGH (AP) Jack McGinley, the brother-in-law of Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney Sr. and a part owner of the team, died Saturday of cancer, family members said. He was 85.
McGinley was married to the late Marie Ellen Rooney McGinley, brother of Art Rooney Sr., who founded the Steelers in 1933.
Though Rooney Sr. sold the Steelers to Alexis Thompson in 1941 and bought into the Philadelphia Eagles, he reacquired the Steelers less than a year later. McGinley's father, Jack, purchased a stake in the Steelers from Rooney in 1946.
Each of the elder McGinley's four children subsequently inherited part of the team. Two later died and their shares were bought by the Rooney family. Jack McGinley and his sister, Rita, owned the only remaining shares of the team not held by Art Rooney Sr.'s five sons including Dan, the team chairman and a Hall of Fame executive.
Mose Tolliver
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) Folk artist Mose Tolliver, whose self-portraits and vivid images of nature, people, animals and the female form, done in humble house paint, made him one of the leaders of the modern-day "outsider art" movement, died Monday. He was in his 80s.
The self-taught artist, who signed his work Mose T, died of pneumonia at Baptist Medical Center East after years of declining health, family members said. Various dates have been given for his birth, with 1920 listed by some collectors and galleries.
Tolliver began painting in the 1960s after being severely injured while working in a furniture factory. He was said to have first gained notice when he hung his paintings on trees in his front yard and sold them for a few dollars to passers-by.
Anton Haardt, author of "Mose T from A to Z: The Folk Art of Mose Tolliver," was an early admirer and began buying his work and reselling it, getting it noticed by dealers.
His self-portraits over the years conveyed a range of emotions, she said, from the early years when he painted himself with a pipe to the later years when he included a crutch. Some could be "grotesque."
Mose T's paintings can sell for thousands of dollars today and are in museum collections, including the Museum of American Folk Art in New York, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Smithsonian Institution and the New Orleans Museum of Art.
But collectors say it can be hard to find an original since his relatives adopted a similar painting style and signed "Mose T" to their art as his fame grew.
Ross-Clayton Funeral Home in Montgomery, which was handling arrangements, did not have a confirmed date of birth.
Correction




In an Oct. 31 obituary on the folk artist Mose Tolliver, The Associated Press erroneously described the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. It is privately supported, not part of the federal Smithsonian Institution.
