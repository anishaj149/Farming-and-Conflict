A look at economic developments and stock market activity around the world Thursday:
LONDON Britain's Serious Fraud Office said it has launched a preliminary inquiry into the operations of AIG Financial Products Corp., a British subsidiary of bailed-out insurer American International Group, Inc. The agency said it was cooperating with U.S. authorities who were already investigating AIG Financial Products Corp. The Serious Fraud Office said its investigation did not involve AIG's insurance business in Britain or elsewhere. AIG's troubles led to a bailout by the U.S. government for fear its collapse would be catastrophic for the system. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed down 32.16 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,202.10
PARIS France's economy will sink into a recession in 2009, shrinking by at least 1 percent, the finance minister said. Christine Lagarde blamed the dismal figures on the world economic crisis and said they reflected negative growth in the fourth quarter of 2008. The projections do "not mean that the situation is going to get worse in the coming months," the minister said in a statement. The CAC-40 in France was 63.38 points, or 2.1 percent, lower at 2,964.34. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany's DAX declined 122.53 points, or 2.7 percent, to 4,407.56. The CAC-40 in France was 63.38 points, or 2.1 percent, lower at 2,964.34.
SAO PAULO Brazilian beef exports plunged 35 percent in January compared to the same month last year because of the global meltdown. The Brazilian Beef Exporters Association says the nation's meat producers shipped 81.8 million metric tons (90.2 million U.S. tons) abroad during the month. That's down from 124.7 million metric tons (137.5 U.S. tons) for January 2008. Brazilian stocks fell on for the fourth consecutive day as concerns about the U.S. economy persisted. Brazil's Ibovespa index closed down 0.8 percent to 40,501. Other Latin American markets also fell: Mexico's IPC by 0.5 percent to 19,358, Argentina's Merval by 2.1 percent to 1,085, and Chile's IPC by 0.7 percent to 2,607.
CAIRO Egypt's economic growth rate could fall by 50 percent in the current fiscal year, a leading international bank said, as the global financial meltdown pummels Suez Canal and tourism revenues two financial mainstays for the Arab world's most populous nation. Egyptian officials had projected that economic growth would slow moderately to between 5 and 6 percent in fiscal 2008-2009 from the previous year's 7 percent.
SHANGHAI, China Chinese banks extended a record 1.62 trillion yuan ($237 billion) in loans in January, more than double the year before, as lenders heeded government calls to loosen credit controls to help revive the economy. Total bank loans rose by 814.1 billion yuan ($119 billion), nearly 104 percent over lending in January 2008, when the government was still imposing stringent curbs on credit as it battled inflation, the People's Bank of China reported. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index lost ground, dipping 12.73 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,248.09. The Shenzhen Composite Index for China's smaller, second exchange edged up 0.9 percent to 723.12.
MADRID Spain's National Statistics Institute confirmed that the country was in a recession after the economy shrunk by 1 percent in the final quarter of 2008. The fourth-quarter figure followed negative growth of 0.3 percent in the third quarter. Two successive quarters of negative growth is one common definition of a recession.
KIEV, Ukraine Ukraine's finance minister resigned on over budget and policy disagreements with the prime minister in yet another sign of the country's deep economic troubles, brought about by the global financial crisis. Viktor Pynzenyk, 54, a long-time ally of premier Yulia Tymoshenko, said he was resigning due to the government's refusal to cut spending and reduce this year's huge budget deficit at a time when the country is struggling to pay its debts.
HONG KONG Hong Kong shares dropped more than 2 percent amid skepticism over U.S. measures to boost the world's largest economy and heal its banking sector. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index lost 310.91points, or 2.3 percent, to 13,228.30.
TOKYO Japanese electronics company Pioneer Corp. will cut 10,000 jobs globally to cope with sinking sales of car audio equipment and flat-screen TVs. It will also withdraw from its money-losing plasma display business. The massive job cuts are the latest from Japanese corporate giants, which are slashing their payrolls worldwide, reducing production and forecasting annual losses amid a global economic slump. Sony Corp. is shedding 8,000 workers while Nissan Motor Co. and NEC Corp. are each cutting 20,000. Japanese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Nikkei index sank to its lowest in nearly three months, falling 240.58 points, or 3.03 percent, to 7,705.36.
