Following is a summary of top stories in the energy sector Tuesday afternoon.
Energy Dept. Expects Lower Oil Prices
The monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook from the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) sees more softening in oil prices, as increased production over the next two years offsets "moderate" world oil demand growth.
The spot price of West Texas crude is expected to average $87 this month, down from $93 last month. The Energy Department estimates crude will average $86 a barrel this year and $82 a barrel in 2009. That compares with $72 per barrel in 2007.
Higher crude prices will bring higher retail prices. Gasoline and diesel are projected to average over $3 a gallon this year, with gasoline peaking around $3.40 a gallon this spring.
The EIA trimmed its 2008 world oil consumption forecast by about 200,000 barrels per day, to 1.4 million barrels per day as the risk of a global economic slowdown increases.
Oil futures retreated on the outlook for softer prices. Light, sweet crude for March delivery dropped 81 cents to settle at $92.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. March heating oil futures fell 1.33 cents to settle at $2.5911 a gallon on the Nymex, while March gasoline futures slipped 2.82 cents to settle at $2.368 a gallon.
Natural gas lost 9.5 cents to settle at $8.436 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Petroleum Inventories Expected to Rise Again
The Energy Department's weekly petroleum inventories report is due out Wednesday. The consensus of analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires calls for an increase of 2.5 million barrels in crude oil supplies and a rise of 1.5 million barrels in gasoline inventories.
Distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are expected to fall by 1.4 million barrels. Refinery usage is forecast to be unchanged at 84.3 percent of capacity.
OPEC Oil Exports Totaled $675 Billion Last Year
The Energy Information Administration tallied up the oil export revenue made by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last year. EIA says OPEC members earned about $675 billion in 2007, up 10 percent from 2006.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Saudi Arabia had the biggest share $194 billion, or 29 percent of all OPEC revenue. The United Arab Emirates brought in $63 billion, Iran $57 billion, Nigeria $55 billion and Kuwait $54 billion.
EIA estimates OPEC's oil export revenue could reach $863 billion this year and then fall to $797 billion in 2009 as oil prices decline.
Refiners Will Have to Reconfigure Plants
Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) kicked off its annual weeklong industry conference in Houston with a report saying global refiners must invest more in coming years to process growing supplies of feedstocks other than conventional crude oil.
The CERA report said failure to reconfigure in a timely manner could lead to shortfalls of diesel, heating oil and other fuel sources.
CERA estimates overall supply will be more than enough to meet rising demand, but the types of hydrocarbons in the mix will change significantly. Lighter stocks like natural-gas liquids and biofuels could make up almost a third of total refinery stock in 2020, up from about a fifth last year.
Drivers Pumping Less Gas
A weekly survey by MasterCard SpendingPulse found retail gasoline demand at the pump during the week ending Feb. 8 fell 3.5 percent compared with the previous week. Gasoline demand was down 3.1 percent from a year ago. This is the third straight week demand dropped.
The national average retail price for a gallon of regular fell by 2 cents. The price is down 13 cents over the past four weeks. At $2.96 per gallon, the U.S. average price is at its lowest mark since Nov. 2, but is up 35.2 percent over the comparable week in 2007.
"This is the largest week-to-week decline in gasoline pumped since August," said study author Michael McNamara. "Winter weather in the Mountains and Midwest helped to keep drivers off the roads in the first week of February."
McNamara said unless demand picks up significantly, there will be year-over-year declines in demand for the next several weeks. "In February 2007 the country was pumping between 65 million and 66 million barrels per week. We are well below that pace right now," he said.
SpendingPulse is a macroeconomic indicator of national retail sales based on aggregate sales activity in the MasterCard payments network, together with estimates for all other payment forms, including cash and check. MasterCard SpendingPulse does not represent MasterCard financial performance.
XTO Buying $1 Billion in Petroleum Properties
XTO Energy Inc. plans to buy $1 billion of bolt-on oil and gas properties. The oil and gas producer also said it will not pursue the master limited partnership (MLP) it was considering.
XTO agreed with a number of parties to acquire more than 25 sites in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Colorado.
XTO expects the acquisitions to add 212 billion cubic feet of natural-gas equivalent to its proved reserves. That is almost 2 percent of the total reserves XTO reported at the end of 2007.
The company expects to increase production 17 percent to 20 percent this year and is targeting nearly 33 percent more in reserves by the end of next year.
"We believe the set of transactions speaks to XTO's belief on the future development potential of these areas," said KeyBanc capital Markets analyst Jack Aydin. "XTO has also elected not to pursue its planned MLP a trend we have seen from several other companies (which we believe is a good move)."
XTO also reported fourth-quarter profit rose over 8 percent to $464 million or 95 cents a share. Revenue climbed 33 percent to $1.59 billion.
XTO shares hit a new high of $57.94 before sliding back o 56.33, down 20 cents in afternoon trading.
Rowan Resumes Deepwater Projects in Gulf of Mexico
Rowan Cos. Inc. signed a multi-well contract with McMoRan Oil & Gas Corp. LLC that includes re-entering the Blackbeard Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Gorilla IV jackup rig has been committed for a minimum of 90 days, priced at a day rate in the mid $190,000s. The initial Blackbeard well was drilled to a depth of just over 30,000 feet during 2005-2006 by a Rowan jackup rig.
Rowan's Super Gorilla class jackup the Bob Palmer is undergoing final preparations for its initial assignment on BP's Eldorado Prospect. That rig will drill wells at least 28,000 feet down.
