A look at the Multinational Force and Observers operation in the Sinai Peninsula:
 Headquarters: Rome
 Mandate: to ensure enforcement of the provisions of the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, which led to Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai. In practice, it serves mostly as a buffer between the two countries in case any tensions break out again. An independent operation formed according to the peace agreement and not a U.N. organization.
 Makeup: 1,800 peacekeepers from 10 countries the United States, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Fiji, France, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand and Uruguay. Norway also provides the force with three officers, although it is not technically a member.
 Main base: El-Gorah, about three miles south of the Rafah border crossing to Gaza in northern Sinai.
