A look at financial developments and what happened in some stock markets around the world Wednesday:
STOCKHOLM, Sweden Sweden's Parliament approved a 1.5 trillion kronor ($200 billion) rescue package for the nation's financial sector. The measure allows the government to give the money in credit guarantees to banks and mortgage lenders to improve liquidity amid the global financial turmoil. It also creates a 15 billion kronor ($2 billion) "stability fund" to bail out any Swedish banks that run into solvency problems.
LONDON Britain will increase government spending to cushion the country's fall into recession, Treasury chief Alistair Darling said, suggesting he intends to drop decade-old fiscal rules limiting borrowing. Meanwhile, Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 316.16 points, or 8.1 percent, higher at 4,242.54. France's CAC-40 was up 287.65 points, or 9.2 percent, at 3,402.57.
FRANKFURT, Germany Germany's DAX ended slightly lower after a 40 percent slump in Volkswagen AG shares. VW's biggest shareholder Porsche AG said it will offer some stock to ease liquidity constraints that had pushed up VW shares fivefold in the preceding two days. The DAX closed 14.76 points, or 0.3 percent, down at 4,808.69.
WASHINGTON The International Monetary Fund said it is creating a new emergency loan program to quickly get money to developing countries with strong economies that are facing cash crunches in the global financial crisis. The IMF's executive board approved a new short-term loan program, which could provide up $100 billion in aid, to quickly get funds to the countries. The so-called Group of 24 poorer countries, including nations from Latin America, Asia and Africa, had asked for such a program earlier this month.
BUDAPEST, Hungary Hungary's stock market rose on word of an aid package of up to $25.1 billion from the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the World Bank.
The IMF will provide a 17-month standby loan of $15.7 billion (12.5 billion euros), the European Union is ready to lend Hungary $8.1 billion (6.5 billion euros), and the World Bank will give $1.3 billion (1 billion euros) to keep Hungary's economy from collapsing. The benchmark BUX stock index closed up 14 percent and the Hungarian forint rose against the euro and dollar.
KIEV, Ukraine Ukraine's parliament approved legislation that the International Monetary Fund set as a condition for an emergency loan, raising hopes that this ex-Soviet republic, hit hard by the global crisis, will avoid a meltdown. Lawmakers gave overall backing to a series of bills necessary to secure the $16.5 billion loan that will be spent on shoring up a banking sector, shaken by the global credit crunch and confidence crisis, and Ukraine's currency, the hryvna, which has lost more than a quarter of its value.
MANILA, Philippines Philippine stocks rebounded, ending five days of losses. The Philippine Stock Exchange index rose 76.23 points, or 4.47 percent, to 1,780.64, after plummeting 15 percent in the last five sessions.
SEOUL, South Korea South Korean stocks ended a volatile day lower as investors reacted nervously to a media report the country had been offered assistance by the IMF which the government denied. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 30.19 points, or 3 percent, to 968.97. At one point, it surged as much as 7.9 percent and later it sank by the same margin.
HONG KONG Hong Kong stocks rose after a huge rally the day before, but the market trimmed its gains as investors cashed in profits. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed up 105.78 points, or 0.84 percent, to 12,702.07, building on Tuesday's spectacular 14.4 rise the biggest percentage gain in nearly 11 years.
SHANGHAI, China Chinese shares fell back, as a brief-lived rally fizzled amid a resurgence of pessimism over the economic outlook. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index shed 2.94 percent, or 52.01 points, to 1,719.81. It had gained 2.8 percent the day before, tracking a regional recovery. The smaller Shenzhen Composite Index shrank 2.26 percent on Wednesday to 472.36.
TOKYO Japanese shares rose for a second day, with buying triggered by the dollar's rebound against the yen and strong gains booked overnight on Wall Street. After an up-and-down session, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index ended up 7.7 percent, or 589.98 points, at 8,211.90, retaking the psychologically key 8,000 plateau for the first time in a week. That follows a 6.4 percent gain Tuesday.
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil Brazil's Ibovespa index led the climb with a 4.4 percent jump to 34,845, one day after rising a steep 13 percent alongside lesser gains on Wall Street. Mexico's IPC index rose 2.9 percent to 19,163. Argentina's Merval rose 2.6 percent to 918, Chile's IPSA index rose 2 percent to 2,437 and Colombia's IGBC rose 4.5 percent to 6,959. The gains reflected optimism that the markets were near a bottom after sliding for months on fears of a global economic slowdown. In Mexico, the benchmark IPC index had lost nearly 50 percent of its value since May.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina The Argentine Central Bank spent nearly $1 billion to support its precipitously falling currency as fears of a pension funds takeover drove the peso to its lowest level in nearly six years. The peso closed at 3.39 to the dollar after plummeting to 3.44 in the early afternoon amid concern that nationalizing at least $23 billion in private pension funds could drain capital from Argentina's stock markets.
