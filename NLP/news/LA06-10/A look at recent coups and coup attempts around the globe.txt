Some recent coups and coup attempts around the world:
 February 2006: In the Philippines, generals put down a coup plot and the president declared a weeklong state of emergency. Later about 200 people, including military officers, religious leaders and civilians, were questioned.
 March 2005: In Kyrgyzstan, protesters stormed the presidential headquarters, forcing Soviet-era leader Askar Akayev to flee the country. Opposition leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev was named acting prime minister and president.
 March 2004: In the West African state of Equatorial Guinea, an attempt failed to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the longtime ruler of Africa's third-largest oil producer. Obiang seized power in a coup in 1979. Mark Thatcher, son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, pleads guilty in unwittingly helping to fund the coup attempt.
 June 8, 2003: In the West African nation of Mauritania, a coup attempt followed a government crackdown on Islamic activists that started with the U.S.-led Iraq war. President Maaouya Sid'Ahmed Ould Taya came to power in a bloodless coup in 1984.

 Jan. 7-8, 2001: In the Ivory Coast, President Laurent Gbagbo returned to power after a failed coup killed at least 10 people.
 May 19, 2000: In Fiji, a businessman and son of an opposition lawmaker, led a coup, taking hostages including the prime minister and holding them for two months until the military met his demands for an amnesty, including eliminating the multiracial constitution and ousting the government.
 Oct. 27, 1999: In Armenia, five gunmen, claiming a coup, stormed into parliament, killing the prime minister and at least six other people. The attackers took about 40 hostages and claimed they were saving Armenia from economic collapse and official corruption. Police arrested 18 people in the attack.
 Oct. 12, 1999: In Pakistan, Gen. Pervez Musharraf led a bloodless coup.
