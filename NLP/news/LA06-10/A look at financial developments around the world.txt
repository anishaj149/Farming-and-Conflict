A look at what happened in some stock markets around the world Friday:
LONDON Iceland reached tentative agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a $2 billion loan over two years, an aid package that comes after the country's banking system collapsed amid the global credit crunch. The government said the deal, which still must be approved by the IMF's board in Washington, will also give Iceland immediate access to $830 million to head off the financial threat to the entire economy.
MOSCOW Both Russian stock exchanges fell dramatically, with blue chips Sberbank and Gazprom down heavily. The exchanges shut down early and won't resume trading until Tuesday. The MICEX plunged 14.2 percent to 513.6 points in early afternoon, when financial regulators suspended trading for a second time. The other exchange, the RTS, dropped 13.7 percent to 549.4 points and was shut down about an hour early. Falling stock prices hit a wide range of Russian companies.
HONG KONG Hong Kong's stock market plunged more than 8 percent, battered by fears of a global recession and weak corporate earnings. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index nose-dived 1,142.11 points, or 8.3 percent, to 12,618.38 the lowest close in almost four years. In financials, HSBC plunged 12.5 percent to 88 Hong Kong dollars, major lender Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd, or ICBC, dropped 7.4 percent to 3.15 Hong Kong dollars, and China Construction Bank lost 8.5 percent to 2.9 Hong Kong dollars.
SEOUL, South Korea South Korea's benchmark stock index dropped, closing below 1,000 points for the first time in more than three years and finishing its worst week on record. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index plummeted 110.96 points, or 10.6 percent, to finish at 938.75, its lowest close since May 2005. The drop pushed the index to its worst weekly fall 20.5 percent since records began to be kept in 1987, according to the stock exchange. The Kospi has now fallen 50.5 percent so far this year, a sharp reversal of the bull market in Korean stocks.
SHANGHAI, China Chinese shares hit a 2-year low, led by real estate developers and financial stocks. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.9 percent, or 35.94 points, to close at 1839.62. The smaller Shenzhen Composite Index slipped 1.7 percent to 505.82.
TOKYO The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average nose-dived 9.6 percent, or 811.90 points, to 7,649.08, bucking modest gains on Wall Street Thursday. It was the first close below 8,000 since May 2003. Shares of Sony Corp. sank 14 percent after it cut its earnings projection for the fiscal year.
SAO PAULO, Brazil Latin American stocks plunged for a fourth straight day on fears that a global recession will keep prices for the region's commodity exports low and continue punishing its biggest currencies. Brazil's Ibovespa index slumped 8.5 percent within the first 30 minutes of trading, but then recovered some lost ground to trade down 5.6 percent at 31,911 at midday. Mexico's benchmark IPC index fell 3.9 percent to 17,101 as investors bet that companies would continue reporting third quarter losses. Argentina's Merval index dropped 6.2 percent to 903.5, losing about 23 percent of its value this week. Chile's IPSA meanwhile slipped 1.2 percent to 2,367, while Colombia's IGBC index fell 4.7 percent to 6,735.
