Colombia's federal prosecutor ordered the arrest Monday of the governor of a northern province for his alleged links with the country's far-right militias.
Chief prosecutor Mario Iguaran ordered the arrest of Trino Luna, governor of the province of Magdalena, said a spokesman for the prosecutor's office who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the case.
Prosecutors are investigating links between Luna and the paramilitary leader Hernan Giraldo. A latecomer to the paramilitaries, Giraldo is alleged to have been one of the largest drug-traffickers in Colombia, exporting tons of cocaine from his stronghold in the Sierra Nevada along the country's Caribbean coast.
Giraldo is alleged to have ordered his fighters to intimidate voters into electing Luna in 2003, when he was the only candidate for governor.
The arrest warrant came less than a day after U.S. President George W. Bush visited Colombia, a country facing its biggest political scandal in decades. The scandal centers on ties between congressional supporters of President Alvaro Uribe and the country's paramilitaries, responsible for massacres and a sizable portion of the cocaine exported from this South American country.
Eight politicians all supporters of Uribe's administration are sitting in jail awaiting trial for their alleged links with the paramilitaries.
Giraldo along with other leading paramilitary warlords are also in jail waiting trial as part of a peace process with the government that will limit their prison time to eight years if they confess all their crimes.
