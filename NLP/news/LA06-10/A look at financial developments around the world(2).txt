A look at financial developments and what happened in some stock markets around the world Thursday:
ATHENS, Greece Greece's conservative government said it will scrap bonuses and cap salaries of top managers whose banks join a 28 billion euro ($36 billion) liquidity support plan. Top managers' wages will not exceed the salary of the Governor of the Bank of Greece, the country's central bank. State-supported banks will not be allowed to distribute more than 35 percent of their profit to shareholders. Officials at the Bank of Greece refused to say how much their governor earns.
LONDON The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 49.11 points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 4,291.65, having been more than 100 points up earlier. FTSE heavyweight stocks BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell weighed on the index too after oil prices slumped to around $65.
FRANKFURT, Germany Germany's DAX fared better than the others, helped by a 12 percent rise in the share price of Deutsche Bank AG, after it reported higher-than-expected third quarter profits. The DAX closed 60.61 points, or 1.3 percent, higher at 4,869.30.
HONG KONG Hong Kong's key stock index soared nearly 13 percent, gaining for a third straight session to lead a region-wide rally. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 1,627.78 points, or 12.8 percent, to 14,329.8.
SEOUL, South Korea South Korea's benchmark stock index soared a record 12 percent and the won surged the most in nearly 11 years after a currency deal between the U.S. and South Korea eased fears about a possible dollar shortage. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 115.75 points, closing at 1,084.72. The gains in both percentage terms and points were the biggest ever, the stock market said.
SHANGHAI, China Chinese shares posted modest gains, led by financial stocks and refiners, after the central bank cut interest rates late the day before. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index opened lower but ended up 2.6 percent, gaining 43.80 points to 1,763.61. The smaller Shenzhen Composite Index added 1.2 percent to 477.77.
TOKYO Japan's key stock index shot up almost 10 percent, lifted by a U.S. rate cut and hopes for a similiar move in Japan and by a rally in Asian markets. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index soared 817.86 points, or 9.96 percent, finishing at 9,029.76 in its third consecutive day of gains. The broader Topix index jumped 8.32 percent to 899.37.
TAIPEI, Taiwan Taiwan shares surged after its central bank announced a quarter percentage point cut in the interest rate to 3 percent. The weighted price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange rose 277.12 points, or 6.3 percent, to close at 4683.64 points.
SAO PAULO, Brazil Latin American stocks soared in early trading. Brazil's Ibovespa index was up 7.6 percent to 37,512, building on even stronger gains in the two previous sessions. Mexico's benchmark IPC index jumped 5 percent to 10,117, Argentina's Merval was up 4.4 percent at 959, Chile's IPSA rose 1.9 percent to 2,484, and Colombia's IGBC rose 3.7 percent to 7,214.
