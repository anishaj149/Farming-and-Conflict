The World Cup has drawn unprecedented interest in Croatia, with soccer the No. 1 topic in newspapers, television talk shows and daily conversation.
With Croatia facing Australia in a match later Thursday that will determine whether it advances to the second round, the national checkered emblem was everywhere in Zagreb painted on faces, emblazoned on buses, and pinned to the lapels of elderly women selling cheese at an open market.
Thousands spent their savings to attend matches in Germany. Politicians weighed in Prime Minister Ivo Sanader wished the team luck and the speaker of parliament adjusted his official visit to Germany to coincide with the match.
At the main Zagreb square, where thousands were expected to watch the game on a big screen, a concert was planned depending on the result, in celebration or solace.
Vecernji list daily, the leading newspaper, reflected the widespread euphoria over the match, branding it as an event of a "special national interest" that would affect the country's image and mood at home and abroad.
"The victory doesn't only bring soccer success," it said in a commentary. "It would affect Croats' state of minds and working elan, it will give us political score points; a tourist season depends on it."
The stakes were high for Croatia, which finished third in the 1998 World Cup in France. Scoreless after matches against Brazil and Japan, it needed a victory to advance to the second round Australia could do it with a draw.
"If we'll play with full force as we did against Brazil, we have all the chances," said Marko Jagnjatovic, a 43-year-old computer expert. "But if we'll be as sluggish as against Japan, we're doomed."
