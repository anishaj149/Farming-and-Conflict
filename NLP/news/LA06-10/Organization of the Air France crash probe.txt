The French accident investigation agency, known by its French acronym BEA, is in charge of the inquiry into what happened to Air France Flight 447, which crashed with 228 aboard en route from Rio to Paris.
The man in charge of the investigation, Alain Bouillard, led the probe into the 2000 crash of the Concorde supersonic jet.
Bouillard said Wednesday the BEA plans to issue its first preliminary report on the Rio-Paris flight by the end of June.
The agency said it is focusing on determining what happened without trying to establish liability or blame. That will be left to the Paris prosecutor, which is leading its own inquiry.
Bouillard said he is leading a team of 20 BEA officials and 30 experts from Airbus and Air France.
He has set up four working groups to focus on:
 sea search operations
 the background and history of the Airbus A330-200 flown by Air France
 the airplane's operations and handling
 its systems and equipment.
Two BEA investigators accompanied by experts from Airbus and Air France are currently in Rio de Janeiro to collect information crucial to the inquiry, in particular radio communications and the radar trajectory.
Investigators are working with the French and Brazilian navies and air traffic controllers of both countries.
International aviation rules dictate that when the location of an accident cannot definitely be established as being in the territory of any country, the state where the airline is registered should take charge of the investigation.
