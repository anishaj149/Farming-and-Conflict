The Nicaraguan army said Wednesday that at least 101 people were killed by Hurricane Felix, after more bodies were pulled from the sea or retrieved from the country's northern jungle.
But authorities have not kept a tally of the missing, making it nearly impossible to determine how many people were killed by the hurricane in remote, roadless communities in Nicaragua. Officials say some of the victims were buried by relatives without informing the government.
On Wednesday, the army said in a news release that the bodies of 21 Nicaraguans 17 women and four men were found floating along Honduras' coast on Tuesday, a week after the hurricane hit. The were immediately buried in the town of Raya, Honduras.
Authorities in Raya just across Nicaragua's northern border informed the Nicaraguan army about the discovery of the bodies, and soldiers verified the location of the impromptu grave.
Another 13 bodies were found near a lagoon in Nicaragua's northern jungle and turned over to relatives for burial, the army said.
The latest bodies bring the total number of confirmed dead from Felix to 101, the Nicaraguan army said.
Felix devastated remote jungle beaches and communities along the Honduras-Nicaragua coast, home to the Miskito Indians, tearing down thousands of homes and killing scores of people.
At least 35 Nicaraguan Miskito Indians that survived the Category-5 hurricane by clinging to wreckage as the storm swamped low-lying reefs and keys were blown clear into Honduras.
