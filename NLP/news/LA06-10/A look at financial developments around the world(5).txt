A look at what happened in some stock markets around the world Wednesday:
Iceland's central bank slashed official interest rates by 3.5 percentage points as it warned that the collapse of its banking system will lead to a "very sharp" contraction in the Nordic nation's economy. The central bank, Sedlabanki, also said it will carry out daily auctions in the foreign exchange market to ensure supplies of foreign currency to the increasingly isolated island country.
Greece has pledged up to 28 billion euros ($38.5 billion) to help its banking sector weather the financial crisis. Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis stressed that the measures were temporary and that the government aimed to not burden taxpayers. Under the rescue package, up to 8 billion euros ($11 billion) will be issued in bonds to boost liquidity. Banks will also be allowed to ask for up to 5 billion euros in state capital in exchange for shares, the minister said.
GERMANY (AP) Chancellor Angela Merkel urged German lawmakers to support her government's planned financial rescue package, worth up to 500 billion euros ($671 billion), arguing that dangers to market stability have not yet been banished. The German package foresees up to 400 billion euros ($536.7 billion) in lending guarantees for banks, and both houses of parliament are expected to vote Friday. Germany's DAX ended 337.56 points, or 6.5 percent, lower at 4,861.63.
JAPAN (AP) Japan's Nikkei 225 index bucked the trend, however, ending up 1.1 percent at 9,547.47. The benchmark soared 14 percent in the previous session its biggest single-day gain ever.
HONG KONG (AP) Chief Executive Donald Tsang said the meltdown was even worse than the 1997 Asian financial crisis and would take a far bigger toll on the global economy. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 834.58 points, or nearly 5 percent, to close at 15,998.30 after rising more than 13 percent the previous two days.
BRAZIL (AP) Brazil's Ibovespa stock index plunged 10 percent and trading was automatically halted for 30 minutes after it hit 37,413. Low commodity prices and weak economic indicators in the U.S. were the reason for the day's plummet, analysts said. Ibovespa heavyweights include state-run oil company Petrobras down 12 percent on the day and Vale do Rio Doce, the world's largest mining company down 14.6 percent. Last week, the index lost 25 percent of its value, but had its biggest one-day gain in a decade on Monday.
