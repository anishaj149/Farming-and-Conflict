A man wanted in the U.S. on charges of involvement in the killing of a U.S. soldier 15 years ago in Panama was elected president of that country's congress on Saturday.
In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey criticized the decision, saying the U.S. is "deeply disappointed that the Panamanian National Assembly elected Pedro Miguel Gonzalez Pinzon from among all its members."
Gonzalez Pinzon is wanted in the U.S. for the June 10, 1992 killing of U.S. Army Sgt. Zak Hernandez Laporte and attempted murder of U.S. Army Sgt. Ronald Marshall.
"The United States wants those responsible ... to face justice," Casey said.
Gonzalez Pinzon has denied taking part in the killings and was declared innocent during a trial in Panama 10 years ago. He said his election Saturday showed Panama's independence from the U.S., which controlled the Panama Canal until 2000.
"The era in which the U.S. had the last word in determining who governed our nation and how they did so is over," he said.
However, he left open the possibility he would step down so that his new position wouldn't threaten negotiations of a trade agreement with the U.S.
"This agreement is a powerful tool for our development," Gonzalez Pinzon said. He called the U.S. indictment against him "unjust and arbitrary."
Hernandez Laporte was gunned down while traveling in a military vehicle outside Panama City. The attack came during then-President George Bush's visit to the nation and lingering anger over the U.S. invasion two years earlier that drove dictator Manuel Noriega from office.
