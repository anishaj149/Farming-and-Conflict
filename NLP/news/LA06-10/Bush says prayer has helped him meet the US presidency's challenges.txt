Prayer has helped President George W. Bush cope with the stresses of leading the U.S., he said Thursday at a breakfast joined by Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain and the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
"I believe in the power of prayer, because I have felt it in my own life," Bush said at the annual National Prayer Breakfast. "It has helped me meet the challenges of the presidency. I understand now clearly the story of the calm in the rough seas."
Several foreign leaders attended, including: President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras, President Tony Saca of El Salvador, and President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi. Other leaders included President Emanuel Mori of the Federated States of Micronesia, and Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi of Samoa.
Edward "Ward" Brehm, chairman of the United States African Development Foundation and the event's main speaker, praised Bush for his administration's attention to Africa.
"Due to his commitment, and the resulting partnership with Congress, there has been an absolutely historic fourfold increase in American assistance to fight poverty and AIDS in Africa," Brehm said to a standing ovation.
The breakfast is staged without government funding every year by the Fellowship Foundation, an evangelical Christian group. About 2,800 people crowded into the Hilton Washington's International Ballroom for this year's event.
