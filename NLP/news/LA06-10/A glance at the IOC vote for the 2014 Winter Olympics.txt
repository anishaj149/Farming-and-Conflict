A glance at the International Olympic Committee vote on Wednesday on the site of the 2014 Winter Olympics.
THE CANDIDATES: Salzburg, Austria; Pyeongchang, South Korea; Sochi, Russia.
THE IOC: The Olympic governing body has 111 members. Ten are royalty. Fourteen are women. Many are former Olympic athletes.
THE VOTERS: Ninety-seven can vote on the first round. Barred are president Jacques Rogge and members whose countries are still in the running: Three Russians, two Koreans, an Austrian and two Germans (one Salzburg event would be held in Germany). Five members are absent.
FINAL PRESENTATIONS: Each city makes a 45-minute presentation to the IOC, with 15 minutes more for questions and answers. Sochi goes first, followed by Salzburg and Pyeongchang.
THE VOTE: Starting at 3:30 p.m. (2130 GMT), IOC members cast secret ballots until one city receives a majority. The city with the fewest votes is eliminated after the first round, and its country's members can vote if there is a second round.
TIEBREAKERS: In the first round, if two cities are tied for second place, they would face a runoff. In the final round, Rogge would ask for a vote of the 15-member executive board to break a tie.
THE ANNOUNCEMENT: The ceremony starts at 5 p.m. (2300 GMT), with Rogge scheduled to open a sealed envelope and announce the winner a few minutes later.
