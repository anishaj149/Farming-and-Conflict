Police on Friday used tear gas and water cannons to scatter 300 demonstrators who marched toward the government palace Friday to remember the killing of two brothers under the Pinochet dictatorship.
Authorities detained 240 protesters but expected to release most after confirming their identities, Police Col. Jorge Constanzo said.
The protest was organized on the eve of the "Day of the Young Combatant," an annual commemoration of the police killings of young leftist brothers Rafael and Eduardo Vergara on March 29, 1985. The late Gen. Augusto Pinochet ruled the country from 1973-1990.
The "Day of the Young Combatant" usually triggers violent nighttime protests both in the center of the capital and in outlying slums. Additional protests were planned for Saturday.
The clashes erupted Friday as the demonstrators marched to the heavily guarded presidential palace.
Police promptly disbanded the protesters, who quickly regrouped and skirmished with the authorities for two hours while chanting anti-government slogans.
President Michelle Bachelet made an appeal to avoid violence during Saturday's scheduled protests.
"There is no reason whatsoever for violence," she said. "The best tribute to the two slain brothers is to respect the rules of democracy."
