A look at what happened in some stock markets around the world Wednesday:
MUNICH, Germany The German state of Bavaria's finance minister resigned, accepting his share of responsibility after BayernLB, a regional public-sector bank, said it would seek 5.4 billion euros ($7.2 billion) in federal government aid. Bavaria's state government owns half of BayernLB; the other half is held by municipally backed local banks. Germany's DAX was down 213.34 points, or 4.5 percent, at 4,571.07.
PARIS France's prime minister says a newly created and state-backed refinancing company will start doling out urgent loans to French banks by the end of the week. The French refinancing firm known as SFRE was set up to support French banks short of liquidity amid the global financial crisis. The French government has pledged 40 billion euros ($54 billion) to provide banks with extra capital as part of an urgent plan to cope with the financial sector meltdown. The CAC-40 in France was 177.22 points, or 5.1 percent, lower at 3,298.18.
MOSCOW Russian stocks shed the previous day's gains as shares in energy companies followed sliding oil prices down again. The U.S.-dollar denominated RTS index closed 7.2 percent lower at 665.8 points while the MICEX index dropped 3.7 percent to 628.1. Russian energy stocks fell sharply on the MICEX stock exchange with oil firms Tatneft and Transneft 7.5 and 5.1 percent lower, respectively. Gas giant Gazprom lost 6.3 percent.
SEOUL, South Korea South Korean stocks dropped sharply amid further heavy selling by foreign investors that has helped push share prices down 40 percent this year after years of strong gains. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 61.51 points, or 5.1 percent, to 1,134.59. At one point, the Kospi fell as much as 8.4 percent before recovering some losses.
TOKYO Japanese stocks tumbled as spreading pessimism over corporate earnings and a strengthening yen sent the benchmark index tumbling almost 7 percent. Stocks opened lower following an overnight retreat on Wall Street, but they widened losses in the afternoon on a flurry of bad news that aggravated fears about the global slowdown. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average fell for the first time in three days, dropping 631.56 points, or 6.79 percent, to 8,674.69
SHANGHAI, China Chinese shares sank on heavy selling of power producers and others reporting weaker-than-expected earnings. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.2 percent, or 62.71 points, to 1,895.82. The smaller Shenzhen Composite Index slipped 1.6 percent to 510.66. Declines were seen across the board, with energy and commodity-related shares falling sharply on expectations of weak demand.
SAO PAULO, Brazil The Brazilian government announced it will allow two state-controlled banks to buy stakes in private financial institutions, hoping to limit damage from the global crisis. The Banco do Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal will be able to buy stakes in other banks, insurance companies and other private institutions needing aid, Finance Minister Guido Mantega said Wednesday. The institutions previously were not allowed to seek help from the state-controlled banks.
