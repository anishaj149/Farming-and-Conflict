Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Monday that the Amazon "belongs to the Brazilian people," and that he wants to protect it while also supporting development.
"We are aware that we must reduce deforestation ... but we are also aware of the importance of developing the Amazon, home to 25 million Brazilians," Silva said in a speech at the annual meeting of Brazil's Institute of Advanced Studies.
The president's remarks appeared to be in response to mounting concern by environmentalists at home and abroad that Brazil will do not do enough on its own to protect the Amazon.
Fueling those concerns is the recent resignation of respected Environment Minister Marina Silva, who was seen as a champion of rain forest preservation. She complained she faced "difficulties" in implementing the federal environmental agenda.
"The world must understand that the Brazilian Amazon has owners, and that the owners are the Brazilian people," the president said Monday. "The owners are the Indians, rubber tappers, fishermen and all of us who are Brazilians."
The Amazon covers 2.4 million square miles (6.1 million square kilometers) an area larger than Western Europe with 63 percent of its territory in Brazil. About 20 percent of the original forest has been razed by ranchers, loggers and developers.
