U.S., Honduran and Nicaraguan soldiers searched remote jungle beaches and the open sea Thursday for survivors and cadavers after Hurricane Felix claimed at least 66 lives, many of them Miskito Indians who died fleeing the Category 5 storm.
At least 25 bodies were found floating in waters off Honduras' coast Thursday, but another 32 people were still missing after their village was destroyed and the boats they fled on capsized. Many of the 52 survivors who washed ashore or were found clinging to debris suffered dehydration, and were being treated in the seaside Honduran village of Villeda Morales.
Officials believe the death toll will rise as authorities search the Miskito coastline that stretches across the Nicaragua-Honduras border for others still missing two days after the hurricane hit.
Rescue and aid was arriving slowly in the region, where descendants of Indians, European settlers and African slaves live in stilt homes on island reefs and in small hamlets, surviving by fishing and diving for lobster.
Interviewed by phone from the swampy jungle area, Honduran Col. Saul Orlando Coca told The Associated Press that 25 bodies had been found Thursday. Earlier, Nicaraguan and Honduran officials had put the death toll at 40, almost all along the Miskito Coast.
The colonel said U.S. and Honduran military officials were patrolling the sea and inlets with helicopters and boats as soldiers walked beaches on foot. Villagers joined the search, paddling their canoes through waters thick with fallen trees.
"There are still bodies of Nicaraguans floating in the sea that we haven't recovered," Coca said.
Martin Alvarez, who captains a fishing boat, radioed in to Nicaraguan authorities that he had pulled nine decomposing bodies from the ocean and was bringing them back to shore, but that had yet to be confirmed, said Ramon Arnesto Soza, a Nicaraguan civil defense chief.
Throughout the region, those who survived the storm lacked food and fresh water. An AP photographer reached one isolated village where the only thing to drink was the water in fallen coconuts.
The Nicaraguan government said it would need at least $30US million (euro22 million) to rebuild.
The U.S. Southern Command sent an amphibious warship, the USS Wasp, to Nicaragua to help coordinate U.S. relief efforts. Venezuela also sent aid, and 57 Cuban doctors and nurses already on medical missions along the Miskito coast helped as well.
Felix developed very quickly over the deep warm waters of the southern Caribbean. Nicaragua posted a hurricane warning less than 24 hours before it hit the coast, and scrambled to notify the remote, autonomous region where many have a long-standing mistrust of the central government. Few realized the storm would grow to a Category 5 hurricane so quickly, and some who were warned didn't believe it would be so dangerous.
By Thursday, Felix was nothing more than a steady rain in the Mexican state of Chiapas, but swollen rivers and unstable mountainsides kept thousands of people from their homes in Central America.
In Honduras, a 15-year-old was buried by mud while trying to repair a water line in Tegucigalpa, and a 34-year-old man drowned in a ditch in El Progreso. These two deaths were included in the earlier death toll of 40.
On Thursday afternoon, emergency officials said a pregnant market vendor was killed in Tegucigalpa when a rainstorm caused a river to overflow. A small boy was missing after being dragged away by the current.
The rainstorm snapped electric cables, cutting power in some parts of the capital, while high winds pushed trees and road signs to the ground.
The remnants of Henriette, meanwhile, dumped rain Thursday on Arizona and New Mexico. That hurricane hit Mexico on Tuesday and Wednesday, near Cabo San Lucas and again near the port city of Guaymas, then weakened over the Sonoran desert.
It left 10 dead, including a man who fell while trying to repair his roof. One woman drowned in high surf in Cabo San Lucas, and landslides buried six people in Acapulco as Henriette marched up the Pacific Coast.
On Thursday, Sonora state police said two more people died. Gaspar Gonzalez Melchor, 25, and his 2-year-old son Marco Antonio Gonzalez Molinares, died from carbon monoxide exposure after they set up a gasoline-powered generator inside their house amid the storm.
Some 5,000 people woke up in Mexican shelters Thursday. San Carlos, a beach town near Guaymas packed with American retirees, was among those hit.
"Waves reached up to the boulevard," said resident Fatima Reyes, 23. "It blew away roofing, trees and signs."
Cuevas reported from Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Associated Press writers Filadelfo Aleman in Managua, Nicaragua, and Richard Jacobsen in Mexico City also contributed to this report.
