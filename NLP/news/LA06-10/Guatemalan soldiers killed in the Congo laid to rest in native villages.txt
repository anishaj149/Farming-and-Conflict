The bodies of eight Guatemalan soldiers killed during a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Congo were laid to rest in their native villages across this Central American nation on Sunday.
In Aldea San Jose, a farming community 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the capital of Guatemala City, hundreds of villagers attended the funeral of Calixto Gomez.
"It was a great sight how men and women lined up to receive him," said the soldier's father, Pedro Gomez.
Calixto leaves behind a wife and five children. The families of the dead will receive $50,000 (euro41,000) compensation from the United Nations.
On Thursday, the Guatemalan government sent U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan a letter questioning the circumstances under which the Guatemalan peacekeepers were killed, in response to media reports that they were on a secret mission to intercept rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army of Uganda.
Guatemalan officials say their peacekeepers should not have been part of any covert activity.
The Jan. 23 attack was the second-deadliest incident since the 16,000-strong peacekeeping mission arrived in the Congo in 1999.
The unit of 105 Guatemalan special forces was added to the U.N. mission because of their extensive experience fighting in wet, equatorial forests and hilly terrain.
