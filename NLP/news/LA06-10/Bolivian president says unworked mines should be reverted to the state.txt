Bolivian President Evo Morales said Monday that privately held mines that have not seen any investment should be returned to the government.
"We have the obligation to recuperate mines the government has licensed where there hasn't yet been one peso invested," said Morales without giving any details as to which mines he was referring to.
Morales, speaking to members of a mining union, said he has asked his economic advisers to prepare an executive order on the matter and asked the union for suggestions.
On Sunday, Morales said his leftist government would take control of a former state-owned tin smelting plant currently run by the Switzerland-based company Glencore International AG.
Morales also said his administrations would study "taking important steps" in the coming months to empower the state mining company Comibol.
"At any moment we're going to get it back. There is a commission that's working on it; all I ask is a little time," said Morales Sunday according to newspaper La Razon.
The announcement comes a month after Morales nationalized Bolivia's natural gas industry giving the state energy company majority control over all energy operations in the country and mandating the state take back majority control of state-run companies that were partially privatized in the 1990s.
Morales also gave foreign companies operating in Bolivia six months to negotiate new contracts or leave the country.
At the time, Morales suggested he would study the nationalization of Bolivia's mining industry, but Alvaro Garcia Linera, his vice president, has said there are no plans to nationalize the industry but rather raise the taxes it pays to the state.
