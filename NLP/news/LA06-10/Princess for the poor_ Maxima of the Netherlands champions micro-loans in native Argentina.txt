Princess Maxima of the Netherlands, a former investment banker who married into the House of Orange, has wrapped up a two-day visit to her native Argentina to promote small business loans for eradicating poverty.
"A well-functioning financial system should include access for all citizens to a wide range of ... financial services," the princess told some 100 Buenos Aires business leaders Tuesday.
Maxima Zorreguieta married Prince Willem-Alexander in 2002 and they have three daughters. She regularly travels the world promoting micro-lending.
Before flying back to the Netherlands on Wednesday, she met with President Cristina Fernandez to back micro-lending in the developing world.
Adam Rogers, a spokesman for the U.N. Capital Development Fund that promotes micro-financing, said celebrities such as the princess have helped attract crucial seed money for small business, education and housing for the poor.
"They're not just jumping on the charity bandwagon," Rogers said. "This is a heartfelt cause for them and they are both very knowledgeable about it."
He added: "Their presence brings attention from certain people who are not normally involved in the issue."
