Seven people who had been buried alive in the rubble of Turkey's quake for four long, hot days were saved Saturday, rewarding the faith of relatives who kept vigil even after experts said the odds of survival were slight.
A French team pulled an 11-year-old girl from the wreckage of a four-story building to applause and cheers of from onlookers.
American and Swiss teams saved an elderly woman in the hard-hit town of Izmit. Also rescued were a 10-year-old Israeli girl - whose first wish was for a soda with a straw - a 95-year-old woman; two sisters, ages 10 and 19; and a 9-year-old boy.
The rescues kept hope alive for relatives of the tens of thousands of people still missing following Tuesday's 7.4-magnitude quake.
Yet for every miracle survivor, hundreds of corpses are pulled from the rubble each day. The official death toll climbed by more than 2,000 Saturday to top 12,000.
Experts say people trapped in such situations usually can survive only 72 hours because of dehydration, and the deadline in this case passed early Friday. The almost-tropical heat across the country this week only made conditions worse.
Some foreign rescue teams were leaving.
A Dutch team left Adapazari on Saturday, and a British team was preparing to depart. "The reason we came here was to save people. That has ended," Edward Pearne, head of the British crew, was quoted by the Anatolia news agency as saying.
The Swiss Disaster Chain also announced it would be going home Monday, having found no one alive since Thursday.
The Israeli girl, Shirin Franko, was "practically in very good condition" after having spent 98 hours trapped in the wreckage of a seven-story building, Dr. Eugene Leibovitz said. The Israeli military pediatrician examined her on site in Cinarcik, a small resort town 30 miles across the Sea of Marmara from Istanbul.
She was "talking, conscious, and even … joking," he said.
A few hours earlier, rescuers had recovered her twin brother's body from the debris. Their father and grandparents were still buried and presumed dead.
More than 130 Israeli soldiers were working with dogs, drills, and floodlights to search the site throughout the night.
The twins' mother, Iris, had been anxiously standing by, watching the Israelis work since shortly after she herself was pulled from the rubble by locals on Wednesday.
The mother moved forward as the rescuers carefully extracted the girl from the ruins and placed her on a stretcher.
The soldiers poured water over Shirin's head, and Leibovitz gave her a quick exam, looking into her mouth and throat. She was extremely dehydrated and said her eyes hurt, her mother said.
Shirin, after being brought out of the ruins, asked rescuers, "Do you have a Coca Cola with ..."
"With lemon?" one of the rescuers asked.
"No," Franko answered. "With a can and a straw, or maybe a bottle."
In nearby Yalova, another resort, crowds cheered when the French specialists pulled out 11-year-old Merve Ekinci. Her father, shaking with emotion, jumped out of an ambulance that had rushed him to the site to see her.
The girl, a grimace of pain on her face, was wrapped in a blanket and rushed to a hospital.
Earlier, in the ruins of another vacation home in the same town, a 95-year-old woman was rescued by a Turkish team, weak but alive, and also taken to a hospital.
In the region around Izmit, near to where the epicenter was located, American and Swiss teams together saved another elderly woman from the ruins.
A unit of a Miami-Dade rescue team spotted the Swiss rescuers working on a site as they were traveling through the area. The dozen U.S. rescuers helped lift the woman from the wreckage and give first aid to her.
"She was in serious condition, but was able to talk," said Rafael Pozo, the team's spokesman.
Another French team down the coast in Golcuk rescued two sisters, ages 19 and 10, with the help of Turkish volunteers.
And a Greek rescue team pulled a 9-year-old boy alive from a collapsed building in Degirmendere, near Izmit, after a 17-hour operation.
"This was a very difficult operation but in the end we returned the boy to his family," a spokesman for the Greek team, Mihalis Panousopoulos, told Greece's state-run NET television.
