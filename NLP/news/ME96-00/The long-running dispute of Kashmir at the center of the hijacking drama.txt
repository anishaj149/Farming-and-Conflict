A look at the disputed northern Indian province, whose full name is Jammu-Kashmir.
---
Geography: Situated at India's northernmost tip, Jammu-Kashmir is the country's only Muslim-dominated province.
It is bordered by Pakistan, Tibet and China. The Kashmir region is split between India and Pakistan, and was divided by the Line of Control under a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire.
---
Capital: Srinagar (summer), Jammu (winter)
---
Population: About 8.5 million
---
Area: 86,580 square miles, or roughly the size of Utah.

The conflict:
-India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they gained independence from Britain, two of them for Kashmir, in 1948 and 1965.
-For the past 10 years, Jammu-Kashmir has been wracked by a separatist insurrection. Nearly a dozen Muslim guerrilla outfits are fighting the Indian army and paramilitary forces to carve out a separate state or merge with Pakistan.
-India accuses Pakistan of arming and fighting the insurgency. Pakistan says it provides only ideological support.
-The hijackers have demanded that India release of Maulana Masood Azhar, a Pakistani religious leader, and several Kashmiri fighters. Azhar was the ideologue of the Harkat ul-Ansar, a Kashmiri group believed to have training camps in Afghanistan. In 1995, the group kidnapped five foreign trekkers and demanded Azhar's freedom. One hostage, a Norwegian, was found decapitated and the other four are still missing and believed dead.
