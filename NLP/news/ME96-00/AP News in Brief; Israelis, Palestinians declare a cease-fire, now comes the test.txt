Israelis and Palestinians on Tuesday warily tested a tentative cease-fire they hoped would end five days of bloodshed, while their leaders prepared for a U.S.-arranged summit aimed at reviving the battered peace. The commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank met with his Palestinian counterparts, the Israeli army said in a statement. Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Eitan agreed to withdraw heavy armaments from the borders of Palestinian-held areas, and Palestinian forces would contain violence. "If the Palestinians don't honor the agreement, and there will be a threat on Israel's forces and citizens, the army will respond accordingly," the statement said.

Study finds gaps in treating Medicare patients
 
CHICAGO (AP) - Treatment of elderly Medicare patients varies widely by state when it comes to heart failure, stroke, breast cancer and other life-threatening illnesses, according to a new federal study. Medicare patients in the Northeast and sparsely populated states were most likely to receive widely accepted treatments for such conditions. However, those in the Southeast and more populated states were least likely to get the same treatments, according to the state-by-state comparison in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. New Hampshire averaged the best quality of care followed by Vermont, Maine, Minnesota and Massachusetts. The lowest-ranked states were New Jersey, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas, which was second to last. Puerto Rico, the only U.S. commonwealth included in the analysis, finished 52nd in a tally counting the District of Columbia.

An unbowed Milosevic has called the opposition puppets of the West. Gen.

Protesters in pig suits gather for presidential debate
 
BOSTON (AP) - The presidential candidates aren't the only ones getting ready for Tuesday night's presidential debate. The "porcine pranksters," for example, have been trying out their pig suits. Protesters by the thousands are preparing to pitch their causes. When Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush are going head-to-head, a varied throng will shout its causes from designated areas outside. Demonstrators call those areas "protest pens" and are not happy about the prospect of being corralled into them. Activists have been converging on the city for first of the three debates between Gore and Bush - this one at the University of Massachusetts.

Studies split on flu vaccine's value for workers and day-care kids
 
CHICAGO (AP) - Flu vaccines could help day-care children and their school-aged siblings stay well and reduce the use of over-prescribed antibiotics, a new study suggests. But while the vaccine could also help keep adults under age 65 healthy and reduce missed work days, a cost-analysis conducted in conjunction with the study found no savings in giving the flu shots to those adults. The study was led by Dr. Eugene S. Hurwitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It appears along with the cost-analysis, done by another CDC researcher, in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
 
Folk musicians play for Native American vote registration drive
 
BROWNING, Mont. (AP) - As residents registered to vote in the November election, Indigo Girls, Bonnie Raitt and Joan Baez performed in the background. The concert, in a high school gymnasium on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, was part of a tour promoters say is intended to stimulate voting by American Indians, and draw attention to environmental issues. "My birthday is the day after Election Day, so make me happy - vote!" Raitt told about 800 people Sunday before she began singing the blues. Raitt likened artists to town criers who "alert the rest of the populace to what needs to be focused on."

PHOENIX (AP) - Buck Showalter has been fired as manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks after a disappointing season that saw the team go from division champions to third place. Showalter, the only manager in the team's history, was hired in November 1995, 2 1/2 years before the Diamondbacks started play and one month after he led the New York Yankees to their first playoff berth in 14 years. Showalter was the third manager fired Monday. Cincinnati's Jack McKeon and Pittsburgh's Gene Lamont lost their jobs earlier.
