Almost imperceptibly, the Clinton administration has put together a string of foreign policy advances, a trend reassuring to officials with memories of what was a decidedly grim international picture just a few months ago.
As a new year begins, officials are highlighting a modest revival of U.S.-Chinese relations following a long period in the deep freeze. Prospects for peace in the Mideast have brightened and there have been long strides toward a permanent settlement in Northern Ireland. The situation in Kosovo has stabilized. And a sore point with much of the rest of the world - the United States' skipping out on its dues owed the United Nations - has been partially put to rest.
For Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, officials say there was no moment more discouraging than the lonely, late night trek she made to the Chinese Embassy last May 7 to apologize to Ambassador Li Zhao Xing for the accidental NATO bombing of Beijing's Embassy in Yugoslavia.
Besides the three Chinese who were killed and the many injured, another casualty was U.S.-Chinese relations, which the United States had been assiduously nurturing. After the bombing, ties with Beijing went into a deep freeze for months.
It was a difficult time for President Clinton and his foreign policy team and not only because of the problems with China. Israelis and Palestinians were not implementing the U.S.-brokered Wye River agreement they had reached in October 1998. Perceived military posturing by North Korea was generating anxiety in Northeast Asia. And there were grave doubts about whether NATO's air war over Yugoslavia would produce a positive outcome.
Now, almost eight months later, grounds for hope exist. Some reasons:
-U.S.-Chinese relations have revived somewhat after their mid-year chill. The two countries were able to reach a trade agreement this past fall that will enable China to join the World Trade Organization, which sets rules for international commerce.
-With the help of almost 50,000 mostly-European forces, the situation in Kosovo has stabilized for the time being. NATO's air war over Yugoslavia proved far more effective in bringing Yugoslavia to heel than skeptics had believed. All Kosovo Albanians who were evicted from the province by Yugoslav forces have returned. But the goal of ethnic harmony between the Albanians and Serbs seems far off.
-With a nudge from U.S. diplomacy, Israeli and Syrian leaders have resumed peace talks for the first time in almost four years. A crucial new round of discussions begins on Monday in West Virginia. Meanwhile, the tone of Israeli-Palestinian relations has improved markedly but progress on substance remains difficult.
-North Korea has bowed to U.S. insistence that it not go ahead with a test of a long-range missile. The prospect of a new test on the heels of one in 1998 had been causing alarm in much of Northeast Asia. Officials caution, however, that it is too early to declare victory in their bid to wean Pyongyang on to a peaceful path.
-With an assist from the United States, a new Protestant-Catholic government has taken power in Northern Ireland, where war has flared intermittently for 30 years. Resistance to disarmament by paramilitaries remains a potential obstacle to a lasting peace.
-An enormous headache for the administration was eased when Congress voted in December to pay $926 million in U.N. arrears over three years. U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke called the vote a "terrain-changing event."
"The Clinton administration has made a lot of progress in foreign policy," says Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic chairman of the House International Relations Committee who now heads the Wilson Center, a research group.
"The big relationships are heading in the right direction," he says, citing U.S. ties with Japan and the European Union. One question mark among analysts, however, is the future of U.S.-Russian relations now that Boris Yeltsin has stepped down as president.
Helmut Sonnenfeldt of the Brookings Institution isn't sure the positive trend of recent months means very much.
"We have a whole host of things that in some respects are better. Whether they are fundamentally better you can't tell," he says.
John Bolton, a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State James A. Baker, believes 2000 will be fraught with dangers.
"The past year has been a year of things that didn't happen," Bolton says. There could be military tensions with China, he says, at the time of Taiwan's presidential elections in March, much as there were when the last such elections were held, in 1996.
Also, Bolton also is concerned that Iraq may be developing weapons of mass destruction with impunity now that more than a year has passed since President Saddam Hussein forced U.N. weapons inspectors out.
A U.N. Security Council resolution approved last month authorizes a new weapons inspection system but Iraq says it won't cooperate. For Saddam, the downside of this stance is that U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq, now almost nine years old, will remain in place.
State Department spokesman James Foley says Iraq is increasingly isolated in the Middle East. Citing the progress Israel and its neighbors have been making, Foley says, "The forces of peace are back in the ascendance. It is not a regional context that is beneficial to Saddam."
Hamilton also finds Iraq a worrisome problem but says the United States must also deal with a larger issue, one that relates to the preeminent place of the United States as a global military and economic power.
"How do we use it for good and for the achievement of American and national interests?" he asks. That's the great challenge in foreign policy as we move into the year ahead."
