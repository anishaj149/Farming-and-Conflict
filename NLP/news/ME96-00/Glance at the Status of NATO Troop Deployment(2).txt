The NATO-led force for Bosnia will eventually include more than 75,000 troops from 20 countries - more than 60,000 inside Bosnia and an additional 18,000 based in the region to provide backup.
Currently, 48,600 troops are in Bosnia patrolling lines separating the warring parties. They are divided into three sectors, each led by one of the main troop contributors. A look at the current status:
---
 
 AMERICAN SECTOR
More than 19,000 troops are patrolling the northeastern American sector, out of a projected 27,100.
The United States - the force's largest contributor - plans to send 20,000 troops to Bosnia; 13,813 have arrived, with the remainder expected from bases in Hungary, Italy and Croatia by mid-February. Based in the northeastern city of Tuzla, the U.S. contingent includes troops from the 1st and 2nd brigades of the 1st Armored Division.
Also due in place by mid-February are nearly 4,000 Swedes, Danes, Finns, Norwegians and Poles; 2,629 have arrived. Patrolling another section are 1,522 Turkish troops.
And 1,158 members of a 1,500-member Russian paratrooper unit have arrived.

 BRITISH SECTOR
There are approximately 15,000 troops in the northwestern British sector, out of an expected 20,500.
About 11,500 of Britain's planned 13,000 troops are in place. They have a base in Sipovo, in Bosnian Croat territory, and a new command headquarters in the northern Serb stronghold of Banja Luka. Their headquarters is in Gornji Vakuf in central Bosnia.
The former British colony of Pakistan said last month that it would send 3,000 troops to the sector. So far, 1,007 have arrived.
More than 500 Canadians have arrived in the area, out of 1,000 expected by Feb. 11. The Czech Republic has sent 215 troops, and another 650 will arrive early next month.
The 2,100-member Dutch contingent is now complete. Belgium also has committed 400 troops to the sector.
Austria will send 150 logistical support troops to the sector by mid-February. Another 150 will head for the French sector.

 FRENCH SECTOR
There are approximately 14,600 troops in the southern French sector, out of a projected 16,000.
Based in Sarajevo, the force includes three infantry battalions with three dozen tanks, 20 attack helicopters, 16 155-mm artillery guns, an anti-tank company and an anti-air contingent.
Italy has 2,560 soldiers in the French sector, deployed in Vogosca northeast of Sarajevo. Portugal sent 370 soldiers to Bosnia on Monday to complete its contingent of 917.
Spain has sent 1,250 troops, most of them based around Mostar, scene of recent Muslim-Croat clashes. By mid-February, an additional 500 troops will be deployed. Some 300 Greek troops are stationed 20 miles northwest of Sarajevo, separating Muslim and Croat lines.
Morocco has committed 1,200 troops, and 650 Egyptian peacekeepers in the region since 1993 may remain there under French command, as will 500 Ukrainians. Malaysia will boost its force of 973 to 1,533 by the end of this month.
Last month, reports said Jordan would send a force of 50, and the tiny principality of Luxembourg promised 20 troops. Recently, 27 Latvian soldiers and 24 of 150 promised from Estonia left for Denmark to train for the Bosnian mission.

 ELSEWHERE
The United States has deployed over 5,500 troops to the southern Hungarian town of Kaposvar and the nearby Taszar air base to provide logistics and facilitate deployment of its troops to Bosnia. About 4,000 U.S. troops are in Croatia and nearly 1,300 in Italy.
An additional 4,500 French troops are outside Bosnia, some based at sea, others at air bases in Italy.
Some 1,200 German troops are in neighboring Croatia to back up the British troops in central Bosnia. One hundred and fifty others left for Croatia on Monday and 1,400 are to follow over the next 10 days to complete the planned contingent of 2,600. Five hundred air force personnel are in Italy, and 270 marines are based in the Adriatic sea.
Hungary has 102 troops stationed in Okucani, central Croatia, with 313 more to be deployed later this week. Slovakia was reported last month to have committed 200 troops to Croatia.
Aside from their troops in the American sector, 51 Norwegians are manning three transport planes in Rimini, Italy.
Greece has 700 troops serving on warships in the Adriatic Sea or manning NATO cargo aircraft supplying troops in Bosnia from air bases in Italy.
Some 1,200 Russian and Belgian troops patrol eastern Slavonia, which is to be handed back to Croatia after four years in rebel Serb hands. The U.N. Security Council earlier this month authorized raising the force to 5,000, with NATO air backing.
There is also a Czech mobile hospital in Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
A peacekeeping force is deployed in Macedonia along the Serbian border. The force includes 700 Scandinavians and 300 Americans.

 CASUALTIES
Eight soldiers have died and 44 have been injured since NATO-led troops started taking their places last month.
Three British soldiers were killed Sunday when their vehicle hit a mine. Two Portuguese and an Italian were killed last week when an explosive went off in a NATO compound. A Swedish soldier died when his car slipped off a road and a British soldier committed suicide at Christmas.
Most of the wounded soldiers were injured by mines or in shooting accidents, but an Italian soldier and an American soldier were hit by sniper fire.
