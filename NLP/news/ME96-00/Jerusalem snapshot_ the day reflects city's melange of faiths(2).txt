Cold winter sunshine splashed the yellow stones of Jerusalem's walled Old City at the intersection of the Via Dolorosa and El-Wad Street, a jostling, noisy crossroad of faiths.
While Christians celebrated Christmas on Friday, Muslims were marking the first prayer-and-rest day of their holy month of Ramadan, and Jews were preparing to usher in the Sabbath at sundown.
The Old City street corner scene on this day, with its vegetable vendors, police and souvenir sellers, was also a snapshot of the three great religions that have deep and indelible roots here.
Under the watchful eyes of armed guards, pale young students in skullcaps streamed out of a yeshiva, or Jewish seminary, blinking in the sudden burst of bright sunlight. Just outside the yeshiva's doorway, a bearded Islamic cleric appealed for donations for charity, and Muslim passers-by dropped coins onto a well-worn prayer rug at his feet.
Only steps away, Christian pilgrims clustered around a tour guide as he gestured toward the spot - marked by a stain on the curving stone wall - where Christian tradition says Simon was made to help Jesus carry his cross. Shopkeeper Hassan Nashishibi, a Palestinian Muslim, beckoned tourists toward his store, filled with crucifixes and olive-wood Nativity scenes.
"Wow," marveled Georges Pereda, a visitor from Paris, as he surveyed the scene. "Muslims, Jews, Christians - everyone is here."
Jerusalem - particularly its Old City, which was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war - has always embodied soaring spirituality and relentless realpolitik. Its crowded confines are home to dozens of holy sites, many of them focal points for the larger tensions that tear at Israel and the Palestinian lands.
One such flashpoint is the hilltop revered by Muslims as the Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, home to Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques. Jews call it the Temple Mount; in biblical times, the first and second Jewish temples stood there.
On Friday - the first Muslim Sabbath since the start last week of Ramadan, when observant Muslims fast from dawn till dusk - more than 150,000 faithful packed the compound for noontime prayers.
In the hours beforehand, Old City streets flowed with a human river of worshippers bound for Al Aqsa, the women in headscarves and many of the men in long robes. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers with M-16 rifles lined the narrow streets and guarded the compound's entryway.
For Friday prayers during Ramadan, Israel relaxed the strict rules that normally keep most West Bank Palestinians out of Jerusalem. But men between 16 and 35 - the age group from which ringleaders of violent stone-throwing clashes are most likely to be drawn - were kept away.
At Al Aqsa, anger was running high at the United States and Britain over last week's bombardment of Iraq. Ikrema Sabri, the mufti of Jerusalem, or its highest-ranking Islamic clergyman, preached a fiery sermon reflecting the discontent.
"We tell the Americans and the British government that Muslims will not kneel down for them!" he told the enormous crowd of worshippers. "Allahu akbar - God is great!" came the roared response.
Just below, in the Old City's Jewish quarter, last-minute preparations for the Jewish Sabbath were under way - shopping, cleaning, cooking. Delicious smells drifted out from behind barred windows.
With sundown and the start of the Sabbath, the enormous yellow-flagstone plaza facing the Western Wall - Judaism's most sacred site - was filled with Jews who came to pray, sing and dance.
In dozens of Christian churches scattered throughout Jerusalem, the day began with joyful Christmas services. Church bells rang out and chants and carols could be heard through the Old City's stone streets, mingling with the wail of the Muslim call to prayer.
Not all the city's Christians were celebrating. Its large contingent of Eastern rite churches, including Armenians, Russians, and Greek Orthodox, observe Christmas in January.
The holiday's passing was a reminder of what likely will be a growing worry in coming months, with the final countdown to the millennium. Israeli authorities fear that Jerusalem increasingly will become a magnet for not only the faithful, but also the mentally unhinged.
Already, there are about a dozen cases each year of what psychiatrists call "Jerusalem Syndrome," in which visitors to the city are seized with the conviction they are biblical figures or on a mission from God.
Israeli police last month began searching for members of a Denver doomsday cult called Concerned Christians, some of whom already have arrived in the country. The cult's leader, Monte Kim Miller, has said he will die in Jerusalem in December 1999 and be resurrected three days later.
