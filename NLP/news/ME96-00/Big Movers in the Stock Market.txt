Some of the stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market, and American Stock Exchange.
 
 NYSE
Digital Equipment, up 5 1/8 to 60
The computer maker said its earnings rose 68 percent in the first three months of this year on strong sales in its storage and server lines. The profit of $ 124 million, or 74 cents a share, for Digital's fiscal third quarter matched many Wall Street estimates. A month ago, Digital said flat personal computer sales and price cuts would lead to profits below the $ 1 per share that analysts had been expecting.
Exxon, up 2 to 84
Chevron, up 1 1/2 to 57
Texaco, up 1 1/2 to 85
Mobil, up 3 1/8 to 116
Amerada Hess, up 2 to 57
Amoco, up 1 to 73 1/2
Atlantic Richfield, up 3 to 118
Oil stocks rose with oil prices amid news the United States and Britain have pushed the United Nations to toughen its negotiating position with Iraq over a possible oil-for-food deal. Despite strong earnings reports, energy stocks struggled Monday amid indications of progress in the Iraq talks. An increase in crude supplies could lower prices and oil company profits. In commodities trading Tuesday, short-term crude prices jumped 5 percent.
 
 RJR Nabisco Holdings, up 1/8 to 29 1/2
The company reported flat first-quarter earnings as higher tobacco profits offset weakness in food sales. RJR said it earned $ 198 million - almost even with a year earlier - but per share earnings rose to 57 cents from 51 cents because less money was paid as preferred stock dividends. Analysts had been expecting earnings of about 56 cents. RJR also said its proxy fight with investor Bennett LeBow cost about 2 cents a share in profit.
 
 Travelers/Aetna Property Casualty, up to 27 from offering at 25
The insurer launched its first public stock sale as more than 35.4 million shares of the company were sold for $ 25 each. Travelers/Aetna was formed in January to hold the property and casualty insurance units of Travelers Group Inc. That business recently acquired the property-casualty business of Aetna Life & Casualty to form the new company, which is the nation's fourth-largest property-casualty insurer.
 
 Jenny Craig, up 1 to 11
The fitness center operator reported Monday evening it had income of $ 8.3 million, or 35 cents a share, for the first three months of the year, up from $ 1.2 million, or 5 cents a share, a year earlier. The company attributed its strong performance to new products, including a cookbook and reformulated vitamin supplements.
 
 Ralston Purina, down 2 to 59 1/8
The company said its second-quarter earnings rose nearly 15 percent, but sales were lower than expected. For the three months ended March 31, Ralston earned $ 59.1 million, or 55 cents a share. Sales fell 17 percent to $ 1.44 billion. Ralston said that while results did not meet expectations, it foresees a brighter second half of the year due to price increases in batteries and pet foods, as well as lower marketing and development costs.
 
 Southwest Airlines, down 2 at 30 1/2
The low-fare carrier reported that first-quarter profits nearly tripled due to higher traffic, but the results were shy of many analyst estimates. Southwest earned $ 33 million, or 22 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31. Revenues rose to $ 772.5 million from $ 621 million.
 
 NASDAQ
Iomega, up 10 to 51
The stock soared 26 percent, building on an 11 percent jump Monday, as the computer component maker announced a stock split and held a boisterous annual meeting where shareholders cheered the fast-growing company's performance. Iomega's drives and storage disks have become popular among people wanting a second way, after their hard drives, to store large amounts of data. Far more data can be stored on Iomega's disks than on ordinary floppy diskettes.
 
 Netscape Communications, up 3 to 61 1/2
The maker of the leading software for finding information on the Internet reported that it earned $ 4.7 million, or 6 cents per share, in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street forecasts. Netscape was not yet a public company in the same period a year ago. In the last three months of 1995, it earned $ 2.4 million, or 3 cents per share.
 
 Cisco Systems, up 1 1/2 to 48
StrataCom, up 1 3-16 to 49
The stocks rose a day after Cisco, the largest maker of machines to link computers, said it will pay $ 4 billion for StrataCom, extending its prominence in moving voice, video and data across private networks to public ones. The deal is the latest merger in the network equipment business, the fastest-growing part of the computer industry.
 
 Secure Computing, down 5 to 23 1/2
The company late Monday reported a first-quarter loss and said it expects to post a loss for the second quarter as well. The loss in the first quarter ended March 31 was impacted by continued investment in sales, marketing, and development for its line of computer-network security products. Secure said it will continue those investments and that its operating expenses should be higher in the second quarter than they were in the first quarter.
 
 Albank Financial, down 2 1/8 to 27
TrustCo Bank said it will drop its proposed $ 460 million acquisition of Albank Financial, which Albank rejected last month. TrustCo had offered cash and stock totaling $ 40 for each of Albank's shares, or $ 33.33 a share after accounting for Albank's recent 6-for-5 stock split. Albank rejected the bid in mid-March, saying it was not for sale.
