Raymond Edde, a Lebanese politician who spent 24 years in self-imposed exile, refusing to return to his homeland unless Syria and Israel withdrew their troops, died Wednesday. He was 87.
A Christian, Edde was a moderate who advocated coexistence with other political and religious groups in Lebanon.
Edde represented the Byblos district north of Beirut in the Lebanese parliament from 1953 to 1976, except for a one-year absence in 1964. He ran unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1958 and 1976 and held various Cabinet positions.
Edde went into self-imposed exile in 1976 after surviving three assassination attempts.
He opposed all foreign interference in Lebanon, and said he would not return unless Israel and Syria withdrew their soldiers from southern Lebanon.
His father, Emile, served as Lebanon's president from 1936 to 1941.

AIKEN, S.C. (AP) - Virgil "Buddy" Raines, a longtime and highly respected Eastern horseman, died Wednesday. He was 89.
Raines trained several top thoroughbreds during his career, including 1962 Preakness winner Greek Money.
Raines, easy to recognize with his trademark Stetson hat, became head trainer for Brookmeade Stable in 1943.
He will be best remembered however, for his training accomplishments with Donald P. Ross's Brandywine Stable, which he joined in 1937.

He was also one of four founders of the Derby Festival.
Ruby was elected to the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in 1975 and to the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. Ruby also received the National Headliners' Award in 1945 as having the best sports column in the nation.
In 1936, he began writing the "Ruby's Report," a column that ran six days a week.
Ruby wrote three books, among them "The Golden Goose," a biography of jockey Roscoe Goose, who rode 1913 Derby long-shot winner Donerail.
Ruby is survived by three children, 11 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.
 
Clifford Sutter
BARNSTABLE, Mass. (AP) - Clifford Sutter, a tennis star who helped move the game from country clubs to city parks, died May 4 of cancer. He was 89.
During his prime in the 1930s, Sutter faced tennis greats such as Bill Tilden and Fred Perry. Sutter was undefeated in Davis Cup matches between 1931-1933 and reached a No. 5 world ranking in 1932. He retired in 1934.
In 1962, concerned about the game's declining popularity, he returned to tennis as president of the Eastern Tennis Association. Sutter initiated a program of instruction and construction in public schools and parks in an effort to bring the game to a wider audience.
 
James Wiley
SEATTLE (AP) - James Wiley, one of the first 24 fliers in the Tuskegee Airmen, the highly decorated all-black 99th Fighter Squadron during World War II, died May 3. He was 81.
During the war he flew a P-40 War Hawk in 101 missions over southern Europe with the squadron, one of the most decorated units in U.S. military history.
Under Tuskegee Airmen escort, not one American bomber was lost to enemy action en route to a wartime mission. The unit earned a combined 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, one Silver Star, one Legion of Merit, eight Purple Hearts and three Presidential Unit citations.
The grandson of a slave, Wiley received a scholarship at the University of Pittsburgh and earned a degree in physics, only to be rejected by several companies. Working as a chauffeur, he heard of a federal pilot training program.
At the air base in Tuskegee, Ala., Wiley became one of the first 24 men who joined the 99th Squadron.
Wiley later returned to Alabama to teach pilots and still had to sit at the back of the bus.
 
David Williams
LOS ANGELES (AP) - David W. Williams, the first black federal judge west of the Mississippi River, died Saturday of pneumonia. He was 90.
Williams was appointed to the federal court in Los Angeles in 1969.
He often handled about 4,000 criminal cases stemming from the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles.
As a lawyer in the 1940s, he joined a small group of black attorneys who worked with Thurgood Marshall, then head of the legal defense arm of the NAACP, to fight the restrictive covenants that barred minorities from living in many parts of Los Angeles.
The covenants were declared unconstitutional in 1948, but racist attitudes continued to deter blacks and other minorities from buying homes in white neighborhoods.
