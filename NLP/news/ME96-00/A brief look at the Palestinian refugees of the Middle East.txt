Some facts about the Palestinian refugees, whose fate is a key sticking point in a U.S.-proposed Israeli-Palestinian peace accord:
---
 
WHO ARE THE REFUGEES?
They are Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli conflicts, taking refuge in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Palestinians have always insisted that the refugees have the right to return to their former homes in Israel; Israel rejects that.

HOW MANY ARE THERE?
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, reports that the number of registered Palestinian refugees has grown from 914,000 in 1950 to more than 3.7 million, according to the latest figures, and continues to rise.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
One-third of registered Palestinian refugees, about 1.2 million, live in recognized refugee camps in UNRWA's area of operations in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-seven of the 59 camps are in the West Bank and Gaza, where the Palestinians want to establish their state.
Dozens of camps were established in the aftermath of the June 1967 Mideast war and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza to accommodate a new wave of displaced persons, both refugees and non-refugees.
The other two-thirds of the registered refugees live in and around cities and towns of host countries and in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, often in the environs of official camps.
