Thumbnail sketches of the six men and one woman who will sit on the National Security Council that will govern Pakistan under coup leader Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf:
-- Musharraf, who overthrew the elected government on Oct. 12, is a veteran of two wars with India with a reputation as a brilliant tactician.
Musharraf joined the army in 1964 and served as a commando in the elite Special Services Group. He was promoted to army chief of staff in 1997. He holds moderate and liberal views on domestic affairs, but is considered hawkish on relations with India.
-- Air Chief Marshal Pervaiz Mehdi Qureshi, a veteran of two wars, was appointed air chief in November 1997. He has received a number of military honors.
-- Admiral Abdul Aziz Mirza, the chief of the Pakistan Navy, fought in Pakistan's 1965 and 1971 wars against India. He joined the navy in 1961 and received his basic training in Turkey and France. He has commanded two submarines, a guided missile destroyer and a fleet of tankers. He was appointed naval chief earlier this month.
-- Muhammad Yaqub, governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, worked for the International Monetary Fund for 20 years before joining ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's first government in 1992 as an economic adviser in the Finance Ministry.
In July 1993, he was appointed to his bank post and initiated tough reforms. He fought hard to curtail government bank borrowing, introduced fiscal discipline and initiated action against Pakistanis who did not pay their bank loans.
-- Attiya Inayatullah, a leading social worker and the only woman on the council. A pioneer of the country's family planning program in the early 1960s, she is the chairperson of the private Family Planning Association of Pakistan and also heads International Planned Parenthood Federation.
-- Imtiaz Sahibzada, a former Cabinet secretary from Pakistan's tribal and deeply conservative Northwest Frontier Province. He is a retired bureaucrat.
-- Sharifuddin Pirzada, served during the 1960s as law minister in the Cabinet of an earlier military ruler, Field Marshal Ayub Khan. He was attorney general in Gen. Zia-ul-Haq's military government in the 1980s.
Pirzada will be a special adviser to Musharraf.
