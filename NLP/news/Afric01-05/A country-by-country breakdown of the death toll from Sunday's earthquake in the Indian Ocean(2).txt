About 58,000 people were killed in 12 countries in southern Asia and Africa from Sunday's massive earthquake and tsunami waves, according to official figures. A breakdown of the toll so far:
- Indonesia: At least 30,000 people were killed, all on Sumatra island, the Health Ministry said.
It said this figure did not include districts on Sumatra's hard-hit western coast, meaning the final death toll will almost certainly rise significantly.
- Sri Lanka: Some 21,715 killed in government and rebel controlled areas. More than 1 million people were displaced.
- India: The Home Ministry said 4,413 deaths have been confirmed, but the toll was expected to climb: A police official said 8,000 people were missing and possibly dead in India's remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, located just north of Sumatra; so far, 90 deaths from the archipelago were among the ministry count.
- Thailand: The government said 1,516 people died, among them more than 700 tourists.
- Somalia: At least 110 killed, said Ali Abdi Awaare, environment minister of the semiautonomous region Puntland. A presidential spokesman earlier said hundreds were killed without giving an exact figure.
- Myanmar: About 90 people were killed, according to reports compiled by international aid agencies.
- Malaysia: At least 65 people, including an unknown number of foreign tourists, were dead, according to official reports.
- Maldives: At least 52 people were confirmed dead.
- Tanzania: At least 10 people, mostly swimmers, said Alfred Tibaigana, police commander in Dar es Salaam.
- Seychelles: Three killed.
- Bangladesh: Two killed.
- Kenya: 1
