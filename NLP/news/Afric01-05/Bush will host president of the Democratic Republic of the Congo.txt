President Bush will host President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo next month.
Kabila ascended to the presidency in January 2001 when his father, Laurent Kabila, was assassinated by his own bodyguards.
The CIA identifies Congo as a "dictatorship; presumably undergoing a transition to representative government."
The five-year civil war in Africa's third-largest country - a conflict that drew in five African armies and became known as Africa's own World War - has finally wound down. But ethnic clashes continue in the gold- and diamond-rich northeast and lasting peace depends on whether a disparate group of former enemies can function as a government.
The White House announced Bush will host Kabila on Nov. 5.
Spokesman Scott McClellan said the two leaders will discuss "the successes of President Kabila's transition government" and efforts to fight AIDS, among other issues.
McClellan also said Bush will host Sri Lanka's prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, on Nov. 4.
Bush will welcome Lithuanian President Rolandas Paksas to the White House on Dec. 8, McClellan said.
