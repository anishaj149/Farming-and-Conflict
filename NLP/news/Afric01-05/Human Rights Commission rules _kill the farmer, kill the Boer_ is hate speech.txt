The slogan "kill the farmer, kill the Boer," used by some black nationalists during the fight to overthrow apartheid, was ruled as hate speech Thursday by South Africa's top human rights body.
The Human Rights Commission ruling was a victory for white farmers, who were disturbed to hear that the slogan was used by members of the ruling the African National Congress at two public meetings last year.
"We have concluded that the calling for the killing of a group of people is an advocacy of hatred, which must amount to harm," commissioner Karthy Govender said, according to the South African Press Association.
Hate speech is a crime under South African law. The commission's ruling Thursday only carries the weight of a recommendation and does not force courts or prosecutors to follow it.
The ANC has distanced itself from the slogan.
"The utterance has never been, cannot and never will be a slogan of the ANC, nor be used by the ANC at all," said ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama.
White farmers in South Africa say they have been the target of an increasing number of attacks they say are racially motivated, but authorities say are simply part of the nation's high level of crime.
