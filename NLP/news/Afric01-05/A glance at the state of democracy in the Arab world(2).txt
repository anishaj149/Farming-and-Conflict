State of democracy in Arab world:
---
ALGERIA: Multiparty state with elected parliament and president. National Liberation Front, dominant party since independence from France 40 years ago, won 2002 parliamentary elections marred by violence. In 1991, fearing fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front would be elected, army aborted final round of election and sparked bloody insurgency.
---
BAHRAIN: Declared constitutional monarchy in 2002 as part of reforms that paved way for first legislative elections in 30 years. Women voted and ran in October election, which secularists narrowly won. Most power still resides with king, Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.
---
EGYPT: President Hosni Mubarak took over from assassinated Anwar Sadat in 1981. His security apparatus and National Democratic Party have almost absolute control over elected parliament. Mubarak periodically stands as only presidential candidate in referendums in which voters can yes or no. Always produce yes vote over 90 percent.
---
IRAQ: U.S.-led coalition expected to run country for at least six months until new Iraqi-run government replaces Saddam Hussein's 35-year dictatorship. Washington promises Iraq will be democracy, but history of repression and deep divisions in society will make that difficult.
---
JORDAN: King Abdullah II, who succeeded late father, King Hussein, has virtually absolute power. Elected parliament has not met since 2001, but Abdullah promises parliamentary elections later this year.
---
KUWAIT: Politics controlled by emir, Sheik Jaber Al Ahmed Al Sabah, and family. Kuwait pioneered among Arabs in electing parliament, in 1963, but emir regularly dismisses national assemblies. Women barred from voting or running for office.
---
LEBANON: Elections regular and lively, but not open because of power-sharing agreement meant to prevent resurgence of 1975-90 sectarian civil war. Legislative seats apportioned equally to Christians and Muslims; prime minister must be Sunni Muslim, president Christian. Syria, dictatorship, wields great influence over Lebanese politics.
---
LIBYA: Moammar Gadhafi in absolute power since 1969 military coup.
---
MOROCCO: King Mohammed VI appoints prime minister and members of government following legislative elections; can fire any minister, dissolve parliament, call for new elections, or rule by decree. Incumbent socialist party won September parliamentary elections praised as clean and fair. Conservative Islamic parties did well.
---
OMAN: Sultan Qaboos became ruler by overthrowing father in 1970. Family has ruled for about 250 years. No political parties or elected legislature.
---
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY: Yasser Arafat under growing pressure to share power after four decades of sole control. Post of Palestinian prime minister recently created.
---
QATAR: Expected to have parliamentary elections in two or three years after holding first municipal elections in 1999, with women fully participating. Famous as home of al-Jazeera satellite TV station, freest in Arab world.
---
SAUDI ARABIA: Crown Prince Abdullah rules on behalf of ailing King Fahd; no elected legislature. In sign royal family feeling pressure to reform, government recently allowed international rights monitors to visit for first time and Abdullah proposed Arab states encourage greater political participation by masses. Abdullah met recently with 40 Saudi reformers.
---
SYRIA: President Bashar Assad wields near-absolute power, disappointed those who expected young, Western-educated doctor to open up politics. Succeeded father, longtime dictator Hafez Assad, who died in 2000.
---
SUDAN: President Omar el-Bashir in power since 1989 coup. Recently moved to lessen influence of fundamentalist Islamic leaders, but democratic reform not on agenda.
---
TUNISIA: Republic dominated by single party, Constitutional Democratic Assembly, since independence from France in 1956. Opposition parties allowed since 1981.
---
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: Federation of states, each controlled by own emir and family.
---
YEMEN: President Ali Abdullah Saleh presides over largely feudal society. Despite constitution, elected parliament and lively press, power rests with military and tribes.
