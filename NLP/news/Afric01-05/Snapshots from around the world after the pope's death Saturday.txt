WADOWICE, Poland (AP) - The people in Pope John Paul II's hometown fell to their knees and wept Saturday as news of his death reached them at the end of a special Mass in the church where he worshipped as a boy.
"His life has come to an end. Our great countryman has died," parish priest the Rev. Jakub Gil told worshippers.
In Warsaw, church bells rang and traffic halted. At Pilsudski Square, the former Victory Square where he conducted a mass in 1979 in then-communist Poland, people laid flowers in the form of a cross. Others walked to church holding candles.
The pope was deeply loved in mainly Roman Catholic Poland, where his 26-year pontificate served as a source of national pride. Gratitude remains strong for his role in helping topple communism and free Poland from Soviet domination.

JERUSALEM (AP) - In the Holy Land where Jesus walked, Jews, Muslims and Christians paid homage Saturday to Pope John Paul II's tireless efforts to embrace people of different faiths.
Though his record was not without controversy, the pope used his frequent homilies and travels to pursue religious reconciliation. His visits to a synagogue in Rome and a mosque in Damascus, Syria, were the first by a pontiff to Jewish and Muslim houses of worship.
Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres said the pope "embodied the best that is within all mankind as well as the commonness of humanity. … His actions and statements transformed relations between the Catholic and Jewish faiths, and made a fundamental impact on the struggle against anti-Semitism. We will miss him."
About 150 worshippers, most of them Palestinians, joined by a few pilgrims, gathered at the Church of the Nativity in Jesus' birthplace, the West Bank town of Bethlehem, to celebrate a special Mass shortly before the pope died.

CAIRO, Egypt - The Arab League expressed sorrow Saturday for the pope's death, calling him a man of peace who encouraged dialogue between nations and religions.
"This is a sad day, we are very sad to lose him," said Hesham Youssef, a spokesman for the secretary general of the league, a group widely seen as a mouthpiece for the Arab world. "We will never forget his noble stance in support of the oppressed people, including the Palestinians," Youssef said.
Sulaiman Awad, a spokesman for Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak said "Egypt received the news (of the pontiff's death) with deep sadness." He said Egypt would send a high-level delegation to the pontiff's funeral.
The Polish-born pontiff, who became history's most-traveled pope, visited several Arab countries including Egypt, Lebanon and Syria during his 25 year- reign, in addition to being the first pope to visit a mosque.

HAVANA (AP) - Fidel Castro's communist government fondly recalled Pope John Paul II's visit to the island seven years ago as it sent condolences Saturday to Roman Catholics after learning of the pontiff's death.
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said the nation's leadership and people had received the news of John Paul's passing "with profound sorrow." Perez Roque said the Cuban government would send a high level delegation to the pope's funeral.
"We always saw, and continue to see, Juan Pablo II as a friend," Perez Roque said. He said Cuban officials would always remember the pope's January 1998 visit to Cuba when he criticized four decades of U.S. trade sanctions against the island.
On Friday night, Cardinal Jaime Ortega - Cuba's top Roman Catholic churchman - made a highly unusual appearance on state television to tell his fellow Cubans that John Paul was nearing death. Ortega was mentioned in the past as a long shot candidate to succeed John Paul.

BEIJING (AP) - After days of ignoring the pope's mounting medical troubles, China's government media announced the pontiff's death in a cursory bulletin by the official news agency.
"In the last days of the pope's life, the Catholic Patriotic Association of China and the Chinese Bishops College extended good wishes for his health," Xinhua news agency reported.
The pope's medical condition were front page news across much of Asia this week, but Chinese media had ignored the developments.
Instead, news of a rare sturgeon being moved to the capital's aquarium was splashed across the front of the popular Beijing Youth Daily. The lead article in the People's Daily newspaper was a report of a phone conversation between President Hu Jintao and his French counterpart, Jacques Chirac.
Neither paper reported that the pope was near death nor that he was the subject of a global vigil.
China broke ties with the Vatican in 1951 and demands that Catholics worship only in churches approved by the state-controlled church group that does not recognize the pope's authority. State churches do acknowledge the pope as a spiritual leader.

MEXICO CITY (AP) - In Mexico City church bells tolled across the capital and mourners draped a black bunting above the entrance of the Basilica of Guadalupe, where the pope canonized the first American Indian saint three years ago.
Crying, clapping and clutching rosaries, about 200 people gathered at the base of a large bronze statue of the pope next to the basilica and began to chant, "John Paul II, the whole world loves you!"
Patricia Lopez, 41, who led the group in a sad recitation of the Lord's Prayer, sobbed uncontrollably as worshippers next to her thrust their arms skyward and rocked to and fro in grief.
"I lost both of my parents and this is a similar pain," said Lopez, who had been praying at the basilica since from the early-morning hours with her 12-year-old daughter, Angela.
Nearly 90 percent of Mexico's 100 million people are at least nominally Catholic, and about 20 million people were believed to have turned out to seethe pope during his initial Latin American trip in 1979. He returned four times, delighting the crowds who clogged the streets and packed sports stadiums when he donned a sombrero, and accompanied mariachis on guitar.

MADRID, Spain (AP) - Spain's Socialist government, which had challenged the pope by endorsing gay marriage and streamlining procedures for abortion and divorce, praised him as an inspiration to both Christians and non-Christians as it joined the world in mourning his death.
Yet thousands of people on Saturday still filled Plaza de Colon, where the pope said Mass before a million worshippers gathered in the shape of a cross in May 2003, when the pontiff paid the last of his five visits to predominantly Roman Catholic Spain.
"He was a man who knew how to live and knew how to die," an unidentified man told Spanish TV.
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose government summoned the Vatican ambassador earlier this year to protest criticism from the pope over Spain's increasingly secular society, sent a telegram to Rome expressing its condolence's over his death.

PARIS (AP) - The bells of Notre Dame Cathedral rang out individually 84 times in homage to the late Pope John Paul II - once for each year of his life.
The cathedral in the heart of Paris stayed open through the night for prayers. More than 3,000 worshippers crammed inside, with 1,000 others gathered outside as the towering cathedral's bells sounded over the French capital.
A giant portrait of John Paul, showing him holding a staff, was hung from the middle of Notre Dame. Mass was said, and worshippers knelt in prayer.
French President Jacques Chirac, in a statement after the pope's death, said the pontiff "touched spirits and hearts" with his courage and determination. "An enlightened and inspired priest, he devoted himself to responding to the search for sense and the thirst for justice that is expressed today on all continents," Chirac said.
