Facts about the five countries President Bush is visiting in Africa:
NIGERIA:
 
---
GEOGRAPHY: 356,675 square miles. Nigeria is a West African country bordering the Atlantic Ocean to its south, its area covering about twice that of California. The terrain ranges from arid plains in the north to tropical hills and plateaus in the center to equatorial lowlands in the south. The Niger River enters the country in the northwest, flows south and emerges in the oil-rich Niger Delta at the Atlantic. Nigeria borders Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger.
---
ECONOMY: Nigeria is Africa's top exporter of oil and the fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. Other exports include cocoa and rubber.
---
PEOPLE: With a population of 126 million, Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation. English is the official language, but Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and Fulani are widely spoken. About 50 percent of Nigerians are Muslims, 40 percent are Christians, and 10 percent follow indigenous beliefs.
---
HISTORY: A former British colony, Nigeria gained independence in 1960. After years of unrest, mismanagement and a string of corrupt military dictators, a new constitution was adopted in 1999 and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed.
---
POLITICS: Olusegun Obasanjo won presidential elections in 1999 and April 2003. He has pledged to fight corruption and mismanagement, and faces an uphill fight to rebuild the petroleum-based economy. He must contend with an impoverished majority and long-standing ethnic, religious and political tensions. Those tensions often pit northern predominantly Muslim Hausas versus southern mainly Christian Igbos and Yorubas; more than 10,000 people have been killed since 1999.
SENEGAL:
 
---
GEOGRAPHY: 75,749 square miles. Senegal, a West African nation on the Atlantic Ocean, is about the size of South Dakota. The terrain is generally low, rolling, plains rising to foothills in the southeast. Senegal shares a common border with Guinea Bissau, Guinea, and Mali. Gambia, flanking the Gambia river, almost fully bisects Senegal.
---
ECONOMY: Senegal's economy is dominated by agriculture, particularly peanut production. Fish, peanuts, phosphate, iron ore, gold and titanium are the main natural resources.
---
PEOPLE: Population is 10.5 million. French is the official language, but Wolof is widely spoken. Ninety-four percent of Senegalese are Muslims, 5 percent are Christians, and traditional beliefs still exist.
---
HISTORY: Gained independence from France in 1960. Senegal joined with Gambia to form the confederation of Senegambia in 1982. However, the integration of the two countries was never carried out, and the union was officially dissolved in 1989. Senegal has participated in many international peacekeeping missions.
---
POLITICS: President Abdoulaye Wade, a longtime opposition leader, came to power in 2000 presidential elections, vowing to improve living standards and spark development. Previously, the Socialist party ruled the country. Despite peace talks, a separatist group based in the southern province Casamance has sporadically clashed with government forces since 1982.
SOUTH AFRICA:
---
GEOGRAPHY: 487,965 square miles. South Africa forms the tip of the African continent and is nearly twice the size of Texas. It is dominated by the seaside city of Cape Town in the southwest and the industrial city of Johannesburg in the center. Its neighbors are Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho.
---
ECONOMY: South Africa is the largest economy in Africa, with one-third of the continent's GDP. It is the world's largest producer of platinum, gold and chromium and has several major auto factories. Agricultural products include corn, wheat, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables, beef, poultry, mutton, wool and dairy products.
---
PEOPLE: Population is 44 million. There are 11 official languages including English, Afrikaans and nine local languages, including Zulu. Sixty-eight percent are Christian, 2 percent are Muslim and indigenous beliefs are common.
---
HISTORY: South Africa gained independence from Britain in 1910. From 1948 until 1994, it was dominated by the apartheid government, which brutally repressed its black and mixed-race population. In 1994, the nation held its first all-race elections and Nelson Mandela became the first black president.
---
POLITICS: Thabo Mbeki won presidential elections in 1999. There are high levels of unemployment and economic problems related to apartheid. Crime, corruption and HIV/AIDS are other problems.
BOTSWANA:
---
GEOGRAPHY: 240,148 square miles. Botswana is a landlocked country in southern Africa that is roughly the size of France. It is dominated by the Kalahari desert in the south and center of the country with the Okavango Delta in the northwest. Its neighbors are Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
---
ECONOMY: The economy is dominated by diamond mining; Botswana is the source of roughly one-third of the world's $6 billion output of gem diamonds. Tourism, subsistence farming and cattle raising are other key sectors.
---
PEOPLE: Population is 1.5 million. English is the official language, but Setswana is widely spoken. Eighty-five percent of the people follow indigenous beliefs and 15 percent are Christian.
---
HISTORY: The former British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name when it gained independence peacefully in 1966. Diamonds were discovered a year later, helping fuel more than three decades of economic growth.
---
POLITICS: President Festus Mogae won free democratic elections in 1998. High levels of unemployment continue to be a problem. Botswana has the world's highest HIV/AIDS infection rate.
UGANDA:
---
GEOGRAPHY: 90,783 square miles. Uganda is a landlocked East African country that is slightly smaller than Oregon. The terrain ranges from semi-desert in the northeast to tropical rain forest in the south. Uganda is the source of the White Nile and shares Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, with Kenya and Tanzania. Its other neighbors are Rwanda, Congo and Sudan.
---
ECONOMY: Coffee is Uganda's biggest money-earner. Cotton, tea, tobacco, corn, peanuts, bananas and sugarcane also thrive. Some copper and cobalt are mined.
---
PEOPLE: Population is 24 million. English is the official language, but KiSwahili is widely spoken. Sixty-three percent of Ugandans are Christians, 6 percent are Muslims, and traditional beliefs are common.
---
HISTORY: A former British protectorate, Uganda gained independence in 1962. After civil wars and mismanagement under dictators Idi Amin Dada, Milton Obote and Tito Okello, former guerrilla leader Yoweri Museveni seized power in 1986 and has led Uganda to economic recovery and relative political stability.
---
POLITICS: Museveni won presidential elections in 1996 and 2001, although political parties were banned and all candidates had to run as individuals without the backing of a party. The government is fighting rebellions in the north. Last year, Ugandan troops entered Sudan, where the rebels have bases.
