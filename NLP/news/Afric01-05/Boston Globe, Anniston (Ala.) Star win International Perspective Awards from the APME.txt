The Boston Globe and The Anniston (Ala.) Star won the second annual APME International Perspective Awards for reports about health care and housing.
The Globe won for newspapers over 50,000 circulation for a report showing first-hand how lack of basic health care kills thousands of people around the world each day.
The Star won in the under 50,000 circulation category for coverage linking Jimmy Carter Work Projects in Anniston and Durban, South Africa. The newspaper was a co-winner of the inaugural International Perspective Award.
The winners were selected from 47 nominations for the award, created by APME in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to encourage newspapers to emphasize making international news relevant to local readers. The contest was for work published between July 1, 2002, and June 30. Thirteen newspapers were selected as finalists.
The Boston Globe began to look closely at the state of medicine around the world after being challenged by an economist whose World Health Organization study concluded that 8.8 million deaths could be prevented each year with basic health care. The economist asked why news media weren't reporting such a disaster.
The idea mushroomed into a project in which four teams of reporters and photographers were dispatched around the world to document distant suffering and to look for solutions. The result was a 16-page special section reported from different parts of the world as well as a full presentation on the newspaper's Web site.
"Instead of writing about a report, the Globe showed initiative and creativity by fanning out worldwide to bring readers examples of how the lack of a small amount money or access to simple medical procedures - that most of us take for granted - can be the difference between life and death," said judge Glenn Proctor, associate editor, The Star-Ledger, Newark, N.J. "Even though the Globe's size makes it relatively easy to do such a story, the key is still to plan it and execute it. The Globe did that."
The Anniston entry underscored the shared experiences and values of communities that need decent housing, and receive it through the Habitat for Humanity program, the judges said. They added that the stories were well-written and were coupled with strong photographs in a pleasing display.
"Going to Africa to show how a Habitat for Humanity development had changed a neighborhood was the only way to advance Habitat's next move - a greatly anticipated building project to Alabama," Proctor said. "Even though the demographics between the two places are different, the anticipation, excitement and feelings of home ownership are the same."
The judges also noted that the newspaper filled out its Africa trip by doing a story on AIDS in Africa and in Alabama and by showing another side of Africa in a well-written travel piece.
Finalists in the 50,000 circulation and above category were:
- Daily Herald, Arlington Heights, Ill., for stories of several regions of India as observed by a Daily Herald reporter and photographer and told through the eyes of local immigrants.
- The Seattle Times, for a look at how the AIDS epidemic has impacted a local woman and her family in Zimbabwe, a story with broader implications throughout the country.
- Los Angeles Times, for its look at Latino children who migrate illegally and alone to the United States looking for parents who abandoned them.
- The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle, for a four-part series examining how a major local employer, Boeing, is quietly making plans to use fewer American workers and to move more jobs overseas.
- San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News, for stories reporting how the technology industry exploits the poverty of China and other Asian countries to produce and later reclaim inexpensive personal computers sold to the West.
- Albany (N.Y.) Times Union, for a special project linking the local community to the human devastation of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
- The Dallas Morning News, for its look at human trafficking that has transported immigrants to Dallas-Fort Worth and beyond.
- Florida Today, Melbourne, Fla., for a revealing look at how Mexicans have surpassed Cubans to become the fastest-growing immigrant population in Florida.
Finalists in the under 50,000 circulation category:
- The Free Lance-Star, Fredericksburg, Va., for covering the impact of Virginia politics on international reproductive health projects.
- The Missoulian of Missoula, Mont., for coverage on the impact of a summer-away program for Northern Ireland children.
- The Beaver County (Pa.) Times, for an analysis of how the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident holds lessons for its readership, also near a nuclear power plant.
- Daily Camera, Boulder, Colo., for the story of a Boulder woman returning to Cambodia to find her family.
- Tucson (Ariz.) Citizen for coverage of Mexican women and children attempting to enter the U.S. to unite with families.
Besides Proctor, judges were Carol Nunnelley, who directs APME's roundtables, training and international coverage projects; E.J. Mitchell, managing editor, The Detroit News; Scott Angus, editor, the Janesville (Wis.) Gazette; and Tom Kent, deputy managing editor, The Associated Press, New York.
Winners will receive their awards at the APME national conference, Oct. 15-18 in Phoenix. APME is an organization of editors and managing editors of the more than 1,500 newspapers served by the AP.
