STANDARD BEARER
Retiring soccer star Mia Hamm was elected by U.S. athletes to carry the flag in Sunday's closing ceremony. Hamm won her second Olympic gold medal this week when the U.S. team beat Brazil. She also was part of the 1996 gold-medal team and the 2000 team that won silver.
 
AMERICAN BRONZE
The United States won the bronze medal in men's basketball, beating Lithuania 104-96. The Americans got 22 points from Shawn Marion, 15 from Allen Iverson and 14 apiece from Lamar Odom and Stephon Marbury.
 
HOLD THAT GAME!
The United States and Lithuania both arrived for the bronze-medal game wearing white uniforms, delaying the start for 48 minutes. An official from USA Basketball went back to the luxury liner in Piraeus Harbor, where the team is staying, to get red uniforms.
 
POWELL SCRATCHED
Secretary of State Colin Powell canceled his trip to Greece at the last minute partly because of concern his presence - expected to be met with anti-war protests - might have disrupted the closing ceremony at the Olympics, State Department officials said.
 
DAILY DOPE
- John Capel, last year's 200-meter world champion, was replaced on the U.S. 400-meter relay team because he tested positive for marijuana. He was set to run in the semifinals but U.S. coach George Williams pulled him from the lineup when he learned of the test result. The Americans won silver in the finals.
-Hungarian weightlifter Ferenc Gyurkovics was stripped of his silver medal and kicked out of the Olympics for using steroids.
-Puerto Rican wrestler Mabel Fonseca was expelled after testing positive for the steroid stanozolol. She finished fifth in the 121-pound (55-kg) category.
-The IOC announcement extended to 22 the record number of athletes busted for doping in Athens. The previous record was 12 at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Five medals have been revoked: two golds, two bronzes and one silver.
 
COMING UP
Light heavyweight Andre Ward can win the only U.S. gold in boxing. … The 26.2-mile marathon starts in the village of Marathon, winding through the streets of Athens to Panathinaikon Stadium, site of the 1896 Olympics. … Medals are awarded in rhythmic gymnastics, taekwondo, women's team handball, men's volleyball, men's water polo and men's freestyle wrestling. … The games end with the closing ceremony at the Olympic stadium.
 
WEATHER
The high temperature at the main Olympic complex reached 86 degrees under sunny skies. The forecast for Sunday was for more sunshine and 84 degrees.
 
QUOTE OF THE DAY
"We held our poise like the veterans always do. This is just the greatest. I wouldn't trade it for the world."
- U.S. basketball gold medalist Diana Taurasi.
