About 32,000 boys from 26 countries came together to scuba dive, canoe, raft and compete for merit badges as they participated in "the Olympics of Boy Scouting."
This year's nine-day National Scout Jamboree in Virginia featured the largest contingent since 1973, when 64,000 attended at dual sites in Idaho and Pennsylvania, organizers said.
"This is great. I like to travel and I like to see how other scouts do things," said Igor Guncic, a scout leader from Rijeka, Croatia. Guncic was one of three adults who accompanied a group of 10 boys to the jamboree, marking the first time that Croatians attended the American event.
"Maybe we can pick up some ideas - and maybe we can give some ideas to them," Guncic said.
Their first impressions of America?
"Their food is too much pepper," said 14-year-old Marin Golubovic, also of Rijeka, who spent a few days in Louisiana with fellow scouts before coming to the jamboree.
President Bush will visit on Sunday and address the scouts. During his campaign, Bush often praised the Boy Scouts, and he defended the organization when it came under attack for excluding gay leaders.
The international scouts from countries including Japan, Malta, Belize, Poland, Gambia and England were spread throughout the camp so they can mingle with Americans, said John F. Pyfer, Jr., chairman of the Scouts' International Operations.
"Language has never been a problem," Pyfer said. "They participate and, quite frankly, the friendships last forever."
About 17,000 tents went up Monday, the first day of the festival which is held every four years. About 200 doctors and nurses were on hand, in addition to a U.S. Army field hospital staffed with more than 220 people.
Or, looking at it from a different angle, organizers expected the scouts to consume more than 479,000 eggs, 76,000 hamburgers, 90,000 pancakes, 240,000 sausage links, 10 tons of beef stew and a 14 miles of subs.
During the nine days at Fort A.P. Hill, the Scouts also have access to exhibits dotted throughout the 15,000-acre site set up by the National Park Services and other agencies.
Fort A.P. Hill, about 40 miles north of Richmond, has hosted the jamboree every four years since 1981. Since 1937, nearly 600,000 Boy Scouts and leaders from throughout the nation have participated in the program.
