The Washington Post and The New York Times were named Saturday by the American Society of Newspaper Editors as winners of its awards for deadline news reporting in 2004.
The Jesse Laventhol Prize for deadline reporting by a team was awarded to the Post for its coverage of the tsunami disaster in South Asia. Michael Dobbs, Rama Lakshmi, John Lancaster, Peter Goodman and Alan Sipress comprised the team praised by judges for delivering "a stunning amount of information (that) blended a sweeping narrative with clarity and economy of expression."
Dexter Filkins of the Times was awarded the Laventhol prize for deadline reporting by an individual for his coverage of urban warfare in Fallujah, Iraq. The judges described Filkins' stories as vivid, colorful and engaging to the reader.
The Jesse Laventhol prizes each carry a $10,000 cash award.
