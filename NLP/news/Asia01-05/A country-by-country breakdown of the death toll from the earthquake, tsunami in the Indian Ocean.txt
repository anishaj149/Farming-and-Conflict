At least 117,321 people were killed in 11 countries in southern Asia and Africa from Sunday's massive earthquake and tsunami waves, according to official figures. A breakdown of the toll so far:
- Indonesia: At least 79,940 people were killed on Sumatra island, the government said.
It is still counting deaths in districts on Sumatra's hard-hit western coast, meaning the final toll will likely rise.
- Sri Lanka: Some 27,268 killed in government and rebel controlled areas. About 1 million people were displaced.
- India: The government said 7,368 deaths have been confirmed, but the toll was expected to climb: A police official said 8,000 people were missing and possibly dead in India's remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, located just north of Sumatra.
- Thailand: The government said 2,394 people died.
- Somalia: At least 114 killed, said Ali Abdi Awaare, environment minister of the semiautonomous region Puntland. A presidential spokesman earlier said hundreds were killed without giving an exact figure.
- Myanmar: About 90 people were killed, according to reports compiled by international aid agencies.
- Malaysia: At least 65 people, including an unknown number of foreign tourists, were dead, according to official reports.
- Maldives: At least 69 people were confirmed dead.
- Tanzania: At least 10 people killed, mostly swimmers, said Alfred Tibaigana, police commander in Dar es Salaam.
- Bangladesh: Two killed.
- Kenya: One killed.
