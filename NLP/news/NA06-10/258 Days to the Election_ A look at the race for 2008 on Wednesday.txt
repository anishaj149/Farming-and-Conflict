Teamsters union endorses Obama
WASHINGTON (AP) Sen. Barack Obama won an endorsement from the powerful Teamsters union on Wednesday, critical labor support for the Democratic front-runner with contests looming in Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania.
"There was very, very strong support for him" among the union's members, said James P. Hoffa, president of the 1.4-million member union, in an interview with The Associated Press.
Hoffa planned to meet with Obama on Wednesday in Texas, the site of the next Democratic primary against Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Teamsters endorsement is expected to help Obama there and in Ohio on March 4, as well as in Pennsylvania on April 22.
The Teamsters have 80,000 members in Pennsylvania, 60,000 in Ohio and 17,000 in Texas, Hoffa said. Besides those members on the ground, the Teamsters plan to have their members and their families from around the country work for Obama, Hoffa said.
Union support will be key in the Democratic primaries in the next few weeks, particularly in Ohio on March 4 and Pennsylvania on April 22. Ohio and Pennsylvania have some of the nation's largest number of union workers, with more than 15 percent of the work force unionized in Pennsylvania and more than 14 percent in Ohio.
McCain: Bush should veto torture bill
YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (AP) Republican John McCain said President Bush should veto a measure that would bar the CIA from using waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods on terror suspects.
McCain voted against the bill, which would limit the CIA to using only the 19 interrogation techniques listed in the Army field manual.
His vote was controversial because the manual prohibits waterboarding a simulated drowning technique that McCain opposes yet McCain doesn't want the CIA bound by the manual and its prohibitions.
McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, is well-known for his opposition to waterboarding, which puts him at odds with the Bush administration.
"I knew I would be criticized for it," McCain told reporters Wednesday in Ohio. "I think I can show my record is clear. I said there should be additional techniques allowed to other agencies of government as long as they were not" torture.
Clinton: Obama offers words, not actions
NEW YORK (AP) Hillary Rodham Clinton dismissed Democratic rival Barack Obama on Wednesday as leading a movement with little to show for his eloquence and promises.
"It's time to get real about how we actually win this election," Clinton declared at a fundraiser at Hunter College. "It's time that we move from good words to good works, from sound bites to sound solutions ... This campaign goes on!"
With her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on the ropes after 10 straight losses to Obama, Clinton went beyond her frequent complaint that the Illinois senator lacked the experience to be president. She depicted his candidacy as a "campaign about a campaign" while casting herself as a champion of the middle class.
"Others might be joining a movement. I'm joining you on the night shift, on the day shift," Clinton said to loud applause and cheers.
The former first lady congratulated Obama for his victories in Wisconsin and Hawaii on Tuesday and acknowledged he had inspired voters to dream again. But she said she was the candidate best suited to fulfill those dreams.
Obama increases delegate lead
WASHINGTON (AP) Barack Obama captured most of the delegates in Wisconsin and Hawaii Tuesday, increasing his lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president.
Obama won at least 56 delegates in the two states, with one still to be awarded. Hillary Rodham Clinton won at least 37.
In the overall race for the nomination, Obama led with 1,351 delegates, including separately chosen party and elected officials known as superdelegates. Clinton had 1,262.
Obama has built the lead by winning 10 straight contests since Super Tuesday. Among pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses, Obama had a 154-delegate edge. It takes 2,025 delegates to secure the Democratic nomination.
On the Republican side, McCain won at least 34 delegates in Wisconsin and Washington state, with 22 delegates still to be awarded. The race in one Wisconsin congressional district was too close to call Wednesday, and complete results in Washington could take several days.
Overall, McCain had 957 delegates and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee had 254. It takes 1,191 delegates to claim the Republican nomination.
Huckabee urges Texans to keep him in
PLANO, Texas (AP) Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee told Texas voters Wednesday that the race "ain't over until Texas says it's over."
"We win Texas and it all changes," Huckabee said of his long-shot campaign.
The former Arkansas governor told about 1,000 people at Collin County Community College in suburban Dallas that he's the best choice for conservative voters in "the largest Republican state in the country." He promised to ban abortions and gay marriage, and his pledge to reform the tax code brought the loudest applause of his 50-minute speech.
Huckabee continues to campaign in Texas and elsewhere, despite Republican rival John McCain's almost certain nomination. The Arizona senator is far ahead of Huckabee in the race for the 1,191 delegates needed to secure the nomination.
Huckabee hasn't won a primary since Feb. 9, when he scored a narrow victory in Louisiana and a big one in Kansas.
Texas votes March 4.
"I don't know if any person running for office has ever depended on a single state the way I am depending on Texas," Huckabee said. "Texas is an awfully big state. And it's going to make an awfully big noise come March the 4th."
Ex-president, husband, superdelegate
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) The Democratic nomination for president could come down to a vote-by-vote struggle for superdelegates, and while Hillary Rodham Clinton has lost her delegate advantage over Barack Obama, she knows she can bank on one superdelegate no matter what.
Bill Clinton is guaranteed a spot as a superdelegate: Safe to say his wife gets his vote. With the two candidates separated by 85 delegates, every vote counts.
So, is it an unfair edge to be married to a super-duper-delegate, a former two-term president, the last Democrat to hold the office and a leader who's still wildly popular within the party?
Critics have said the unpledged superdelegate system can overturn the wishes of voters and grass-roots political movements. Those nearly 800 lawmakers, governors and party officials who wear the tag "superdelegate" could tip the nomination to one candidate even if the other gets more votes in primaries and caucuses.
Unlike pledged delegates won through a primary or a caucus, superdelegates can vote for whomever they choose, and they are not beholden to vote for the candidate they endorse.
Bill Clinton: Hillary needs Texas, Ohio
BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) Former President Clinton said Wednesday he believes his wife needs victories in the Texas and Ohio primaries next month to save her presidential candidacy.
"If she wins in Texas and Ohio, I think she'll be the nominee," Clinton told several hundred supporters during a campaign appearance for Hillary Rodham Clinton in a downtown parking lot. "If you don't deliver for her, I don't think she can be."
It was an acknowledgment he repeated earlier in Galveston when he began a daylong Texas tour trying to stop the momentum of Sen. Barack Obama, his wife's rival for the Democratic nomination.
Texas and Ohio hold primaries March 4.
