They say a picture is worth a thousand words. But what about an original sound recording?
Twenty-five culturally important recordings including an episode of "The Lone Ranger," President Franklin D. Roosevelt's address to Congress the day after the Pearl Harbor attack and one of the Rolling Stones' most famous songs were selected Tuesday for preservation in a special sound archive.
Every year the Librarian of Congress chooses a variety of sound recordings to include in the National Recording Registry. The recordings are nominated by the members of the public and by a panel of music, sound and preservation experts, the library's National Recording Preservation Board.
The panel also aids the librarian in selecting what recordings to add to the archive.
The board's coordinator, Steve Leggett, said its goal is to ensure that historically or aesthetically important recordings are preserved for future generations.
"A lot of recordings have disappeared over the years," Leggett said.
The registry was created by Congress in 2000. With the new recordings, the entire archive will feature 225 fragments of sound.
The board is accepting nominations of recordings that are at least 10 years old for the 2007 registry.
"We really encourage members of the public to nominate, because they can come up with some very different possibilities," Leggett said.
He noted that last year two public nominations were included in the registry recordings of a foghorn in the Midwest and a high school marching band from Modesto, Calif., playing Beethoven in a competition.
The 2006 additions to the registry are:
