President Jalal Talabani said Wednesday that Iraqi forces will take over security of all provinces in the country by the end of the year. U.S. forces currently are responsible for the security of 17 of Iraq's 18 provinces.
"Iraqi forces will take over the security in all provinces by the end of the year," Talabani told reporters.
Iraqi leaders have said that their goal is to be in full control of the country's security by the end of 2006. Talabani's statement, in a press conference after a meeting with top Iraqi security officials, was the most specific yet by the government on the subject.
He did not specify what the U.S. role after an Iraqi security takeover would be.
