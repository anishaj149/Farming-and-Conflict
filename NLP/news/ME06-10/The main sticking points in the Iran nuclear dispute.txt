The main sticking points in the dispute over Iran's nuclear program:
 The U.N. Security Council gave Iran until Thursday to temporarily halt uranium enrichment as a precondition for talks aimed at permanently ending enrichment. Iran has refused a halt, saying that enrichment is its right under international law.
 The United States and its European allies want to impose U.N. sanctions on Iran for defying the deadline. But Russia and China, both major trade partners of Tehran with Security Council veto power, seem reluctant to back any punitive measures.
 International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have tried for months to determine if Tehran is seeking to make weapons with enriched uranium, which can also fuel civilian reactors. Iranian officials have repeatedly refused to provide information sought by the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
