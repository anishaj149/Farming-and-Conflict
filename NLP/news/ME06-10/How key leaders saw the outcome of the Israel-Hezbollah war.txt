Here is what key leaders said about who won the 34-day conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: "The Hezbollah resistance also destroyed the image of Israel as an unbeatable military power. (Israel) was defeated ... and (Hezbollah) hoisted the banner of victory."
Syrian President Bashar Assad: "Israel has been defeated from the beginning. They have become a subject of ridicule."
Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah: "We came out victorious in a war in which big Arab armies were defeated. We are today before a strategic, historic victory, without exaggeration."
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert: "(Israeli) soldiers have, to an extent not yet publicly disclosed, battered this murderous organization, its military and organizational infrastructure, its long-term capabilities, its huge arsenal."
President Bush: "Hezbollah started the crisis, and Hezbollah suffered a defeat in this crisis."
