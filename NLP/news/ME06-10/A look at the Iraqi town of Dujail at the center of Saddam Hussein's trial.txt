A look at the Iraqi town of Dujail, where hundreds of residents were tortured and killed after an assassination attempt against Saddam Hussein in 1982:
THE TOWN
 Farming community about 35 miles north of Baghdad, along the main highway to Mosul.
 Population: About 84,000, mostly Shiites.
 Crops: Dates, watermelons, figs, apples.
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
 Villagers fired on Saddam's motorcade when he entered the town on July 8, 1982, to meet with tribal leaders.
 The Dawa Party, whose current leadership includes Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, claimed responsibility.
 Saddam had banned Dawa and executed its founder and spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Sadr, in 1980.
RETALIATION
 Iraqi army helicopters swiftly fired on villagers.
 Hundreds of residents were rounded up and imprisoned. Many were executed.
 Saddam was charged in the deaths of 148 villagers, but many in Dujail believe the death toll was much higher.
 Victims included women and children, some as young as 11.
SADDAM'S DEFENSE
 Saddam acknowledged taking action against his would-be assassin.
 Subsequent trials led to dozens of executions, but Saddam contended those trials were legal.
