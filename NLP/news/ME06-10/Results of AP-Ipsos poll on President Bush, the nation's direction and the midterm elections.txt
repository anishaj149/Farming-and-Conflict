The Associated Press-Ipsos poll on public attitudes about President Bush, Congress and the midterm elections was conducted Monday through Wednesday and is based on telephone interviews with 1,000 adults from all states except Alaska and Hawaii.
Results were weighted to represent the population by demographic factors such as age, sex, region, race and income.
No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the sample cause the results to vary by more than plus or minus 3 percentage points from the answers that would be obtained if all people in the U.S. were polled.
There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. Results may not total 100 percent because of rounding. An `X' signifies less than 1 percent.
