Key points of the resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council on Friday to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah:
 The resolution calls for the "full cessation" of fighting, under which Hezbollah would stop all attacks and Israel would end offensive military operations.
 Once the fighting ends, the U.N. force in south Lebanon, UNIFIL, would be expanded from 2,000 to 15,000 troops to help coordinate the deployment of 15,000 Lebanese troops and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. The two nations' forces would move "in parallel."
 The resolution spells out a series of steps toward a permanent cease-fire and lasting political solution. Those steps include the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon and respect by both parties for the Blue Line, the U.N.-demarcated border separating Israel and Lebanon.
 Stresses the importance for Lebanon's government to be the only armed force in the country, a provision that is meant to exclude Hezbollah militias from retaining weapons. Measures to enforce that would include banning foreign forces beyond UNIFIL and arms sales without the government's consent.
 Requests the international community act quickly to extend financial and humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people, including funds needed for helping the tens of thousands of displaced Lebanese to return.
 Makes all parties responsible for ensuring that no action is taken that would endanger humanitarian efforts, including the safe passage for convoys to distribute food and medical supplies.
