Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the year-end goal for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal is still achievable, even as both sides question whether such a goal is realistic.
Speaking at a news conference in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Rice also urged Israel not to prejudice a final deal a reference to continued Israeli settlement activity. And in unusually pointed criticism, Rice suggested the Israeli government could do more to improve life for West Bank residents.
Rice arrived in the region late Saturday in her latest mission to advance the troubled talks.
Washington has been pushing for a resolution of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict by the end of President Bush's tenure in January.
