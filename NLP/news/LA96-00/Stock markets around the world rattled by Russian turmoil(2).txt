In a global selloff, investors from Tokyo to Paris and Mexico City on Thursday rushed to dump stocks as worries intensified about Russia's seemingly unending turmoil.
Some stock markets in Asia and Latin America tumbled to levels unseen in several years.
"The Russian situation is going from bad to worse," said Howard Gorges, vice chairman of South China Brokerage in Hong Kong.
On foreign exchange markets:
- The dollar, often perceived as a haven during times of volatility, gained in European trading against the German mark, which has been weakening because of Germany's close business ties to Russia. But later in New York trading, the dollar fell against the mark, reflecting Wall Street's sharp slide.
- The Russian ruble continued its slide against the dollar, and the frantic government suspended dollar sales for the rest of the week. Russian stocks plummeted 17 percent after trading was twice suspended.
- The Bank of Canada, after staying on the sidelines while the nation's dollar tumbled to historic lows in recent weeks, raised its benchmark bank interest rate from 5 percent to 6 percent. The Canadian dollar initially rallied but fell back later in the day.
- The Mexican peso plunged to another all-time closing low against the dollar, despite measures by the Bank of Mexico to raise interest rates failed to bolster the currency. The peso ended the day at midrate of 9.945 to the dollar vs. 9.755 on Wednesday.
- Gold futures prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange, posting fresh 19-year lows in the contract for September delivery.
- Commodity prices collapsed to 21-year lows, with grains and soybeans, cotton, metals, energy futures and foodstuffs all coming under pressure.
On global stock markets:
- In Tokyo, the key 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 3.04 percent, closing at 14,413.79, its lowest close in more than six years. Selling, according to traders, reflected skepticism about the Japanese government's willingness to take more aggressive steps to bail the nation's economy out of its worst recession in decades.
The index lost another 4 percent, or 591.56 points, in Friday morning trading, dropping below the 14,000-point level for the first time in 12 years.
- On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 3.2 percent to close 5,368.5.
- In Frankfurt, Germany, the blue-chip Xetra DAX index finished with a loss of 4.5 percent at 5,012.73.
- In Paris, the CAC 40 index dropped 4.3 percent to close at 3,745.64.
- The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index fell 6.04 percent, to 5,799.46.
- The key index on Brazil's Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, South America's largest, was off 10 percent, ending the day at 6,616, below the 7,000 mark for the first time since Jan. 2, 1997.
- Mexico's key IPC index lost 6.1 percent to end at 3,055.71, preliminary figures show, its lowest close since July 31, 1996.
- In Argentina, the select Merval Index tumbled 10.6 percent to finish at 361.05, its worst closing in 3 years.
- In Venezuela, the Caracas General Stock Index closed down 6.7 percent at 2,905.90, according to preliminary figures.
