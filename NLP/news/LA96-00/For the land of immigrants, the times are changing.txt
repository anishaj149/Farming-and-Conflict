While the growing number of immigrants in America has attracted attention in recent years, the share of the population born elsewhere remains short of what it was a century ago.
A new historical analysis released today by the Census Bureau shows that 7.9 percent of the nation's residents in 1990 were born elsewhere.
That's up from the record low 4.7 percent recorded in 1970, but well short of the peak 14.8 percent recorded in 1890, the bureau reported.
Indeed, estimates released previously indicate the foreign-born share had continued to climb, reaching 9.6 percent by 1997. The new report includes only detailed information through 1990, but adds much more historical data than had been available.
Today's arrivals come from and go to different places than those of the last century.
Europe, long the most common source of new Americans, has dropped to third place behind Latin America and Asia.
And the South and West are increasingly the destination of the new arrivals, rather than the big industrial cities of the North and East that used to be most popular, Census population expert Campbell Gibson said.
A century ago, nearly 90 percent of foreign-born Americans came from Europe, but that dropped to just 22.9 percent by 1990, the Bureau reported.
By comparison, in 1990, 44.3 percent of foreign-born U.S. residents were from Latin America and 26.3 percent were from Asia, the Census Bureau reported.
Indeed, by 1990, Mexico alone was birthplace of nearly as many U.S. residents as all of Europe, 4,298,014 compared to 4,350,403.
The declining percentage of U.S. residents born elsewhere varies considerably from place to place, but for the most part the nation's cities had much larger shares of people born elsewhere 100 years ago.
For example, Boston had 35.3 percent foreign-born residents in 1890, but that fell to 20.0 percent in 1990.
In the same period the share of foreign-born fell from 39.7 percent to just 3.4 percent in Detroit; in Denver it dropped from 23.9 percent to 7.4 percent; it fell from 36.8 percent to 6.1 percent in Minneapolis and in Pittsburgh it has dipped from 30.7 percent to 4.6 percent
On the other hand, Miami counted 59.7 percent of its residents as foreign-born in 1990. Detailed Census records for the city don't go back to 1890, but 25.0 percent of Miami residents were foreign-born in 1920 and that was down to just 9.7 percent in 1940.
Houston's foreign born share climbed from 11.3 percent in 1890 to 17.8 percent 100 years later.
And, Los Angeles' 38.4 percent foreign-born in 1990 was up from 25.3 percent a century earlier.
But over the same period the foreign-born share in San Diego slipped from 25.4 percent to 20.9 percent and in San Francisco it fell from 42.4 percent to 34.0 percent.
Of the foreign-born U.S. residents in 1990, 44.3 percent came from Latin America, 26.3 percent from Asia, 22.9 percent from Europe, 4.0 from North America, 1.9 percent from Africa, 0.5 percent from the Pacific Islands.
In 1890 the shares were Europe, 86.9 percent, North America, 10.6 percent; Asia, 1.2 percent; Latin America, 1.2 percent; Pacific Islands, 0.1 percent.
