It was just one short month ago that the Dow Jones industrials passed 10,000 for the first time, but already the blue chip index has come close to hitting its next one-thousand mark.
The Dow drew within 39 points of 11,000 Friday before retreating.
Even by the compressed standards of the modern stock market, the last 1,000 points in the Dow average were coming with breathtaking speed. Its first close above 10,000 occurred March 29. By comparison, the Dow took four months to move from 6,000 to 7,000, from October 1996 until February 1997.
Any approach of a round number prompts speculation about how long it could last - and, more important, what could turn it around. In keeping with the breakneck speed on Wall Street these days, investors got their answer Friday as interest rates shot higher on a report of strong growth in the economy.
The Commerce Department said the nation's gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced here, advanced a blistering 4.5 percent in the first quarter.
The report stirred fears in the bond market that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee might raise interest rates to slow the economy and contain inflation when it meets May 18. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.66 percent Friday from 5.52 percent late Thursday.
The rise in interest rates sent stocks spinning lower, with the Dow ending the session down 89.34 at 10,789.04.
Richard A. Dickson, an analyst at Scott & Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va., said stocks were vulnerable to backsliding without the support of low rates. "The key fundamental remains interest rates," he said.
But in spite of Friday's pullback, the factors that drove the Dow, and the market in general, are still in place.
Over the past month, investors have begun taking profits from recently high-flying technology, telecommunications and pharmaceutical stocks, and used the money to buy previously out-of-favor shares of cyclical companies, whose fortunes rise and fall with the economy.
Dow stocks, especially those that have reported strong first-quarter earnings, have been the most notable recipients of that shift. Alcoa, which reported first-quarter earnings on April 7, shot up 60 percent in April to over 65 before easing back to 62 1/8 Friday.
IBM, a technology stock that is also sensitive to changes in the economy, easily beat earnings expectations and rose 22 in a single day.
"Hope has emerged that those neglected stocks in the cyclical sectors are emerging from the dead," said Don Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Union in Richmond, Va.
Industrial stocks have also been rising on investors' increasing confidence in the domestic economy, and on the growing perception that the world economy is recovering. Economists believe Latin America has at least stopped bleeding, and Western Europe is reaping the benefits of a recent cut in interest rates.
Robert J. Pelosky, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, wrote this past week that a trip to China and Korea has "led me to conclude that Asia is getting better."
All of that is good news for U.S. companies like Caterpillar and Gillette that export everything from heavy construction machinery to toothpaste. In the long run, it may be enough to sustain the stock market, if investors continue to reinvest their profits from technology shares into industrials.
"There's been a revitalization of the basic industry stocks," said Eugene Peroni, director of equity analysis at The John Nuveen Co. "That's very significant, because it provides another leadership segment for the market."
The Dow ended up 99.37 for the week.
On Friday, the Nasdaq composite rose 14.41 to 2,542.85, but was down 47.84 for the week. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 7.65 to 1,335.18, and was down 21.67 for the week.
The NYSE composite fell 3.79 to 634.30 Friday, giving it a loss of 5.00 for the week.
The Amex composite fell 2.03 to 776.97, and was up 6.61 for the week.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks eased 0.04 to 432.81, up 1.08 for the week.
The Wilshire 5000 index, which represents the combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues, closed Friday at $ 12.3 trillion, down $ 90 billion for the week.
