What happens when five mystery writers convene?
One dies in a suspicious car crash, another's cat disappears, and a despised editor who made a surprise appearance makes a surprise disappearance.
So it goes in "A Conventional Corpse"@ (St. Martin's), Joan Hess' 13th novel in the series about bookseller and amateur sleuth Claire Malloy. It is among the latest hardcover mystery and suspense novels that include works by M.C. Beaton, Stuart Woods, K.C. Constantine, Iris Johansen, Ralph McInerny and Ridley Pearson.
