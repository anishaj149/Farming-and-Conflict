In Russian, the word "lebed" means "swan," and Alexander Lebed must surely believe in the childhood story of the ugly duckling.
By his own accounting, he's not much to look at: square head, pockmarked cheeks, a body like a baby bull and a voice so supernaturally low it seems designed for the ears of some other species. When he talks, he has a nervous twitch that makes his lip curl up on the left, giving the impression - presumably not intended - of a sneer.
People look at him and they see the general he once was - an autocrat, a dictator-in-waiting. He insists that no, he's a democrat, the man who could set Russia free from the grip of Czar Boris, as he likes to call his old antagonist in the Kremlin, Boris Yeltsin.
Critics talk about him as a man in the mold of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean military ruler, and he says, no, his heroes are Charles DeGaulle and Dwight D. Eisenhower, generals who were democrats, men of reason.
The point is, until now, no one could really say if Lebed, who badly wants to be president of Russia, was the ugly duckling or the swan.
Now they'll know. On May 17, Lebed was elected governor of the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, and soon he'll have a track record as a leader of something other than a battalion. One way or another, his feathers will show.
Depending on how he does, Lebed could be in a strong position to become president of Russia in 2000 or 2004.
Strong leaders are a vital part of Russian tradition, and many people yearn for someone like Lebed - a hero - to lift them out of the depression and muck of post-Soviet life. The Cold War may be over, but Russia's president still exercises vast power in his region, and still carries the code to the nuclear button.
And so the question arises: Who is this man?
Is he on the left, the right or the center? He says the center, but what does that mean in Russia these days? Is he authoritarian or libertarian, nationalist or internationalist, friend of the West or its foe?
The first thing that strikes a reader of his autobiography, "My Life and My Country," is that this is a man of overwhelming ambition. Time and again throughout his career, Alexander Ivanovich Lebed has been underestimated. Time and again, he has suffered setbacks. And time and again, he has been patient and he has won.
It happened when he was a kid in southern Russia and decided he wanted to become a military officer. The story, as he relates it, takes on the weight of myth, so remarkable were the obstacles.
There was a broken clavicle that healed badly; he had it rebroken so it would reknit properly. "After all, I thought, I couldn't become an officer with a collarbone like that."
There were multiple rounds of surgery for throat and sinus disorders, no doubt the antecedents of his amazing voice.
He tried skydiving to prepare for paratroop school - that left him hospitalized with multiple broken bones and a severed tendon.
There were tests failed and tantrums thrown, and countless people who told him he'd never make it.
In the end, after two years of trying, he was admitted to officer training school and went on to have a celebrated career as a military officer in Afghanistan, Moldova and elsewhere.
Later, he ran for president against Yeltsin in 1996, did surprisingly well and agreed to join Yeltsin's team as national security chief. In this role, he notched his greatest accomplishment, negotiating the peace in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
By this time he was being seriously viewed as a future president by people like Alexei Chaplygen, an analyst with a Moscow think tank, the Center for Studies in Civil Society.
"His strengths," Chaplygen says now, "include charisma and his ability as a strategist, and also his courage in dealing with all branches of power.
"As for his weaknesses, I can name excessive straightforwardness. For a politician, this is not a very good quality. And also … he doesn't know his limits. He's unpredictable and unmanageable."
Lebed didn't know his limits when he ran for governor of Krasnoyarsk, a region four times the size of Texas, with a Texan pride in its independence and distrust of city slickers.
Lebed had never lived in Krasnoyarsk, and early polls suggested he stood little chance against the incumbent governor, Valery Zubov, a relative bright light among Russia's provincial leaders.
Lebed campaigned tirelessly, short-hopping the region by plane, tromping through the snow and permafrost in more than 100 towns and villages, from close to Mongolia to the Arctic Circle.
He stood outside in the stinging Siberian wind, the only hatless, gloveless man in sight, and answered questions from audiences until they had no more.
"Alexander Ivanovich," people would yell, "are you going to run for president?"
The answer would rumble out in his volcanic bass: "I'm a military man and I'm a man of my word. People are asking me about the election of the year 2000, and so I promise that I will participate in this election only if I succeed in improving the economy in the Krasnoyarsk region."
"Alexander Ivanovich, why do we work without pay and yet our enterprises are fined only for not paying taxes?" others asked.
A sympathetic nod. "I came to the conclusion that in some countries, people live better than we do, in some they live worse, but nowhere do people live so senselessly."
