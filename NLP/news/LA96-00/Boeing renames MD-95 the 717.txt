Boeing Co. said Thursday it was recycling an old name - the 717 - as the new moniker for the McDonnell Douglas MD-95. The company foresees a market of as many as 2,500 of the regional jets during the next 20 years.
Boeing has new orders from several customers for the 100-passenger twinjet, but those customers have not yet decided to announce them, said Thomas Schick, executive vice president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. Schick also said Boeing is working to drop the aircraft's price, currently listed at about $ 32 million.
Boeing inherited the MD-95 program when it merged with McDonnell Douglas last year. The plane is the smallest commercial jet made by Boeing, and is designed for short routes - about 350 miles and up.
"For some time our customers have been after us to get into the 100-seat market," Schick said.
In November, Boeing announced it would phase out production of McDonnell Douglas' MD-80 and MD-90 jetliners, but would keep alive the MD-11 jumbo jet and MD-95. All the MD-series planes are assembled at Boeing's Douglas Products Division at Long Beach, Calif.
So far, only AirTran, formerly Valujet, has said it will buy the new 717, ordering 50 of them and taking options for 50 more in 1995. The plane is to make its first flight in June, and be delivered to AirTran in mid-1999.
By stressing that Boeing has a long-term commitment to the plane - and by dropping its price - more customers are willing to step forward, Schick said.
Bruce Dennis, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group vice president for marketing, said Boeing studies indicate the world's airlines will need 2,500 jetliners of 80-120 seats over the next 20 years.
The 717 designation was once borne by the Boeing plane that in the 1960s became the Air Force's KC-135 aerial tanker. The aircraft was similar to Boeing's 707, and no commercial versions of that plane were ever sold.
Schick said Boeing decided to reuse the number because it was available, and to reflect the 100-seat capacity of the plane.
Boeing currently makes widebody 747s, 767s and 777s, and smaller 737s and 757s. Production of the three-engine 727 ended in the 1980s.
Following Boeing tradition, the initial model will be called the 717-200. Schick said Boeing is studying whether to build larger or smaller versions of the airplane.
Boeing said the 717 will have low operating costs, use short runways and have fast turnaround times at airport gates, giving it the ability to fly as many as 12 one-hour flights a day.
The 717 will compete directly with small jets such as those from Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer. Airbus Industrie, Boeing's remaining rival in large jets, has proposed a similar plane.
