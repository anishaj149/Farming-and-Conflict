On Thursday, the Clinton administration's 30th day in office:
 
 President Clinton flew to St. Louis to begin a selling blitz for his economic program. At a campaign-style rally, he said, "The price of doing the same thing is higher than the price of change."
Other administration officials arranged visits to 28 states to enlist support for the plan.
 
 ---
In the first congressional action on Clinton's program, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee approved his a $ 5.6 billion measure that extends unemployment benefits for the longterm jobless. The House will act on it next week.
 
 ---
In a slap at Clinton's decision to allow people infected with the AIDS virus to immigrate into the United States, the Senate voted to restore the old policy. The White House said Clinton would review his options.
