Here are some leading developments at the Earth Summit:
 
 ---
Marathon negotiations sought to wrap up treaties as President Bush and other heads of state arrived for the summit's climax. Final sticking points included a treaty to protect the world's forests, and a policy statement that would commit developed nations to provide environmental aid to the Third World in specific amounts by specific dates.

President Bush, whose appearance in Panama on Thursday provoked a near riot, can expect a chilly welcome at the U.N. Earth Summit, delegates said.
"There is a generalized feeling of resentment against President Bush," Brazil's education minister and environment minister, Jose Goldemberg, said.
Bush's negotiators watered down or refused to sign pacts to clean up the environment.
---
The chief U.S. delegate, William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said Thursday the Bush administration will sign the so-called global warming treaty and send it quickly to the Senate for ratification.
In addition, the administration will set aside $ 1.4 billion to research and monitor the climate change phenomenon, he said.

Haiti's ambassador to the United Nations, Fritz Longchamp, said the environment in that Caribbean island nation is in "extreme chaos."
It is almost barren of trees, arable land is insufficient to feed the population of 6.5 million and drinking water is in short supply, he said Thursday.
The problems are reflected in health statistics. Thirteen of every 100 children die before they reach their first birthday. The average adult male lives only to the age of 45.
