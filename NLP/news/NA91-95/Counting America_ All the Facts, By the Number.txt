The price of the average hardcover book has topped $ 45, and volumes on technological subjects fetch nearly twice that.
The typical American eats 3 pounds of tuna annually.
There are more than a quarter-million religious congregations in this country.
Those and thousands of other facts jam the 114th edition of the Statistical Abstract of the United States, the government's 1,011-page compendium of America by the numbers.
The volume goes on sale Thursday at Government Printing Office bookstores around country and by mail from either the National Technical Information Service or the printing office. A privately printed version is expected to be available next month.
Changes in the new edition include consolidation of the mining, forestry and fishing sections into a single section entitled Natural Resources. In addition, 96 tables that appeared in the 1993 Abstract have been dropped and 75 new tables added.
The Census Bureau collects the information published in the Abstract, much of it from its own counts and surveys. But it also includes large amounts of data from other government agencies and private sources.
A variety of publishing industry sources were tapped for the table on the price of books which, disclosed the average hardback price of $ 45.25 as of 1992. Technological books averaged $ 81.21, while juvenile volumes were a relatively cheap $ 14.51.
The Agriculture Department reported the nation's per capita consumption of food, including 3.5 pounds of tuna, 9.8 pounds of fresh or frozen fish, 62.8 pounds of beef, 234 eggs, 7.7 pounds of mozzarella cheese and 3.4 pounds of broccoli.
The report on religious congregations is one of the new additions this year, showing 257,648 congregations in the 48 contiguous states. Of these, 52,065 had fewer than 100 members, while 8,717 were big congregations of more than 2,000 members.
Other new tables include people without health insurance by state; juvenile arrests for selected offenses; state lottery sales and use of proceeds; weekly food cost and gross product of U.S. multinational companies.
Among the tables deleted were freshman enrollment in remedial courses, synthetic organic pesticide production, normal heating and cooling degree days for selected cities, votes cast in 1992 presidential primaries and selected characteristics of doctoral scientists and engineers.
Buyers can order the book from the National Technical Information Service by calling 703-487-4650. The volume costs $ 28. The paperback version is stock number PB94-209855 and the clothback is PB94-209848, same price for either.
The Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, has larger supplies of the volume, but charges more. The number to order is 202-783-3238. It is charging $ 38 for the hardbound, stock number 003-024-08757, and $ 32 for the paperback, stock number 003-024-08756-1.
In November, The Reference Press in Austin, Texas plans to begin selling a privately printed version of the abstract. It will sell for 24.95 plus $ 3.50 for shipping and handling by calling 800-486-8666.
