1. Newspaper: Government Probe Shows Travel Regulations Vague A government investigation shows regulations governing travel on military airplanes are so vague that high-level federal officials use them virtually without restriction at a cost of $ 150 million a year, The Milwaukee Journal reported Sunday.The newspaper quoted a draft report by the General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of Congress, as saying the planes based at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., average more than 75 flights a month."The policies and their implementation by the Air Force and the Department of Defense are inadequate and do not provide assurance that the wing is being used appropriately and an adequate deterrent to abuse," the report was quoted as saying.

7. Books and Authors: Gunter Grass Sounds the Call of the Toad --- "To come out for freedom of opinion … is to plead for diversity, to protect the desperately blasphemous outburst, to tolerate the kitsch that blooms everlastingly, to grant admittance at all times to subversive doubt, even where faith has established an entrenched society, to live with the contradictions characteristic of man and human society." - Gunter Grass, speaking in 1973. ---
