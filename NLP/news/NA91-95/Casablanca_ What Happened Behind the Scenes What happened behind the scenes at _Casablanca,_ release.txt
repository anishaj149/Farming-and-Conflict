Casablanca: What Happened Behind the Scenes  What happened behind the scenes at "Casablanca," released 50 years ago, has proven to be at least as interesting as what ended up on film. Here are some of the deals, conflicts and alterations that produced one of Hollywood's most unlikely classics: -The film was based on a play called "Everybody Comes to Rick's" and Warner Bros. paid $ 20,000 to authors Murray Burnett and Joan Allison for rights. It was a record sum for an unproduced play.

-In the original story, Rick's heart is broken by an American called Lois Meredith. They have an affair in Paris without her knowing he's married with two children. When Rick discovers she has another man, he divorces his wife and flees, brokenhearted, to Casablanca.
-Contrary to popular legend, Ronald Reagan was not the original choice to play Rick. In January 1942, The Hollywood Reporter ran an item saying Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan would star in the film, but never said which man would have which role. Film historian Rudy Behlmer contends the item was merely a product of the Warner Bros. publicity machine.
-Contrary to popular legend, George Raft was not the second choice to play Rick. According to a memo sent by studio chief Jack Warner, Raft was campaigning for the role, but Humphrey Bogart was "ideal" for it.
-The first choice to play Ilsa was Hedy Lamarr, star of the 1938 film "Algiers," an inspiration for "Casablanca." MGM wouldn't loan her, however. Producer Hal Wallis then asked independent mogul David O. Selznick for the rights to Ingrid Bergman. Selznick first said no, but then changed his mind when it appeared the actress was rejected for Maria in "For Whom the Bell Tolls." (She eventually got the part.)
-Immigration problems helped Paul Henreid get the part of Victor Laszlo. After the United States entered World War II, the government began rounding up enemy aliens and deporting many to their homelands. Henreid, an Austrian and outspoken anti-Nazi, feared for his safety and believed a studio contract would insure his stay in the United States. He signed with Warners and Laszlo was his first job.
-Dooley Wilson, who played Sam, sang all the songs he was seen performimg on camera but did not play the piano.
-Warners composer Max Steiner hated the film's theme song, "As Time Goes By," and wanted it replaced. But the song was used too many times to make reshooting feasible.
-Filming began without a finished script and four endings were considered: Ilsa stays with Rick; Rick is killed helping Ilsa and Victor escape; Victor is killed, leaving Rick with Ilsa; Rick sends Ilsa off with Victor. Wallis settled on the fourth alternative.
-Four closing lines were considered:
"Louis, I begin to see a reason for your sudden act of patriotism. While you defend your country, you also protect your investment."
"If you ever die a hero's death, Heaven protect the angels."
"Louis, I might have known you'd mix your patriotism with a little larceny."
"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
Wallis settled on the fourth selection three weeks after shooting was completed: He had written the line himself.
-Right before the film's release, Allied troops landed in North Africa and Warner's New York sales office asked for a new ending, in which Bogart and Rains are seen on an invading ship. The plan was scrapped a day later.
