Women more than tripled their presence in the U.S. Senate this year and changed the look and feel of the chamber.
During debate on President Clinton's job stimulus plan, the men argued economic theory and cited grafs and charts.
The women spoke about families and communities.
"We put a very real face on the debate that has not been there before," said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., one of the five new Senate women.
With the 1992 elections, women went from two to six seats. They added a seventh with this year's election of Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchinson to finish the remainder of Lloyd Bentsen's term.
Women in Congress waged fights that led to limited increases in abortion funding and an abortion clinic violence bill and increased funds to attack breast and ovarian cancer. They also helped make sure Head Start got full funding, workers got family leave guarantees and violence against women was addressed in the crime bill.
Two of the newcomers, Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., took spots on the Judiciary Committee. Their presence alone represented a big change from two years ago when the all-male panel was ridiculed for its handling of Anita Hill's sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the other female freshman, previously had served in the House and knew the legislative ropes. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said she was key to pushing through the abortion clinic bill.
