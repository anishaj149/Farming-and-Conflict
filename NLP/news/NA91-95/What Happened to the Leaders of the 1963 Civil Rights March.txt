Profiles of leaders of the 1963 civil rights march on Washington:
 
 MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose "I Have a Dream" speech at the 1963 march launched a new era in the civil rights movement, was shot to death April 4, 1968, on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn. He was 39. James Earl Ray is serving a life sentence for the killing. The years between the 1963 march and his death were full ones for King. In January 1964, he was the first black American to be named Time magazine's "Man of the Year." That December, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, its youngest recipient. After watching President Johnson sign the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law, King worked to remove barriers against black voting in the South. In 1965, King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference expanded its voter registration drives, and led marches in Selma, Ala., and from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted that August. In 1966, King launched a campaign in Chicago to bring recognition to poverty and discrimination in the North. In 1967, he began to speak out against the Vietnam War. Late in 1967, King launched the Poor People's Campaign, in which he hoped to mobilize America's poor to campaign for their economic rights. The idea was to train them in nonviolent protest and then send them to Washington, where they would participate in three months of rallies and protests.
The campaign was carried on after his death, in the summer of 1968.
 
 RALPH ABERNATHY:
The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, King's closest colleague, was with King when he died April 4, 1968. Abernathy took the helm of the SCLC in 1968 after King's death, but he never achieved the same public stature in life as his slain friend. In the years following the march, he joined King in leading other protests - including the 1965 voting rights march from Selma, Ala., to Montgomery, Ala. He led the 1968 Poor People's Campaign to Washington after King's death. Abernathy stepped down as head of the SCLC in 1977. He died of coronary arrest April 17, 1990. He was 64. In the year before his death, many of his fellow civil rights leaders criticized Abernathy for his autobiography, "And the Walls Came Tumbling Down." The book described King's extramarital encounters with several women in the last 24 hours of his life. Abernathy remained the pastor of the West Hunter Street Baptist Church in Atlanta until his death, even after suffering strokes in 1983 and 1986. His tombstone bears a two-word epitaph: "I tried."
 
 BAYARD RUSTIN:
Bayard Rustin, who organized the march on Washington, died Aug. 23, 1987, at age 75, after undergoing surgery for a ruptured appendix. In the years following the march, Rustin continued his work as an organizer. He organized a massive boycott of New York City schools in 1964, as well the march of mourning after King was slain in 1968. After King's death, Rustin helped plan a June 1968 rally in Washington for the Poor People's Campaign. But he quit under pressure from many who thought his views were too moderate. From 1964 until his death, Rustin was an officer of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, a center for civil rights organizing in New York. He spoke out against the Vietnam War, and in his later years became an advocate for human rights worldwide. In the year of his death, he went on human rights missions to Haiti and refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border. He also served on a committee of United States and German citizens aimed at healing the wounds of the Holocaust.
 
 A. PHILIP RANDOLPH:
A. Philip Randolph, who introduced King at the 1963 march, died May 16, 1979, at age 90. Randolph, who founded the first major black trade union - the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters - in 1925, and was a vice president of the AFL-CIO in 1963, helped to organize the march. Because he believed in peaceful change, Randolph, like many other early civil rights leaders, got his share of criticism in the 1960s. He stepped down as president of the union in 1968. But his legacy lives on at the A. Philip Randolph Institute in New York, an organization that aims to boost black voter registration and to improve economic opportunities for blacks. In 1988, his face was put on a United States postage stamp.
 
 ROY WILKINS:
Roy Wilkins, who headed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People at the time of the march, continued at the NAACP until 1977. He left because of health problems and died Sept. 8, 1981, at age 80. Wilkins believed in working within the legal system for equality, and was criticized by some blacks for being too moderate. He spoke out against the concept of black power, which he said bred hatred. When Wilkins became the head of the NAACP in 1931, it had 25,000 members. At his retirement, membership was more than 400,000. The number of NAACP branches nearly tripled in the same period, from 690 to 1,700. Wilkins was succeeded at the NAACP by Benjamin L. Hooks.
 
 JOHN LEWIS:
John Lewis spoke to the crowds at the 1963 march as the 23-year-old chairman of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, which he helped to found. He served as chairman of the SNCC until 1966. Now, at 53, he is a Democratic congressman from Georgia and remains an outspoken champion of civil rights. He was beaten by a state trooper after leading march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge into Selma, Ala., in 1965. After leaving the SNCC, Lewis became a grass-roots organizer for the Field Foundation. He served as executive director of its Atlanta-based Voter Education Project from 1970 to 1977. In 1977, President Carter appointed Lewis director of U.S. operations for ACTION, a federal agency that oversees community-based economic recovery programs. In 1982, Lewis was elected to the Atlanta City Council and began his career in mainstream politics. He was elected to Congress in 1986, defeating another civil rights activist, Julian Bond.
ANDREW YOUNG:
Andrew Young was a special assistant to King at the time of the 1963 march. He later was jailed in protests in Selma, Ala., and St. Augustine, Fla., and was one of the people with King when he was shot in 1968. He helped write the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1972, he was elected to Congress from Georgia, the first black congressman from the state since Reconstruction. President Carter appointed him U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but he resigned under fire for meeting with a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization. He was elected mayor of Atlanta in 1981 and served two terms, until 1989. He ran unsuccessfully for governor of Georgia in 1990. Young is now an executive at an international law and engineering firm in Atlanta and is helping to organize the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996.
 
 WHITNEY YOUNG
Whitney M. Young Jr., who was the executive director of the National Urban League at the time of the 1963 march, continued to lead the league until his death of a heart attack in 1971 at age 49. From the time that he took the helm of the league in 1961 until his death 10 years later, the number of league affiliates grew from 63 to 98 and its budget increased tenfold. Young advised President Johnson on numerous occasions. After Congress outlawed discriminatory employment practices in 1964, Young also advised numerous companies on how to integrate their workplaces. He lost much of his influence at the White House after President Nixon was elected in 1968. But he continued to speak out, especially about the Vietnam War. He said the money used to fight the war could be better spent fixing problems at home.
 
 WALTER REUTHER
Walter Reuther, who headed the United Automobile Workers, was a strong supporter of the civil rights march, and attended the meeting with President Kennedy. His support for the march diverged from the stand of the AFL-CIO leadership, which did not formally back the march. In the years after the march, he was a constant critic of the AFL-CIO leadership, saying it was undemocratic and stagnant. Under his leadership, the UAW split from the AFL-CIO in 1968. His leadership won union members major new contracts in 1964 - including better wages, pensions, retirement and vacation plans. After a two-month strike at Ford in 1967, the union won another major settlement, as well as similar new contracts at General Motors and Chrysler. Reuther died in a plane crash on May 9, 1970.
 
 FLOYD McKISSICK
Floyd B. McKissick Sr., who was the national chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality in 1963, represented CORE at the march because the organization's president, James Farmer, was being held in a Louisiana jail cell. McKissick succeeded Farmer as head of CORE in 1966, a position he held for two years. After leaving CORE, McKissick alienated many in the civil rights movement by switching to the Republican Party. He said he thought as a Republican he could get more help for his dream project, Soul City - a residential and industrial community in rural North Carolina that he hoped would have a population of more than 45,000 by the year 2000. McKissick was appointed a district judge in North Carolina in 1990. He died the next year, of lung cancer, at age 69.
 
 EUGENE CARSON BLAKE
The Rev. Eugene Carson Blake was one of several religious leaders who joined a group of civil rights leaders in a meeting with President Kennedy on the day of the march. Blake, who was a staunch advocate of civil rights, attended the meeting as the chief executive of the United Presbyterian Church and a representative of the National Council of Churches. From 1966 to 1972, he was the top executive of the World Council of Churches in Geneva, Switzerland. He returned to the United States after he retired. Blake was 78 when he died in 1985.
 
 JOACHIM PRINZ
Rabbi Joachim Prinz, who was president of the American Jewish Congress in 1963, was a civil rights leader and a founding chairman of the March on Washington. He spoke at the march and attended the meeting with President Kennedy. Prinz continued as head of the AJC until 1966. He was rabbi of Temple B'nai Abraham in Newark, N.J., from 1939 until his death in 1988 at age 86.
 
 MARIAN ANDERSON
Opera singer Marian Anderson returned to the Lincoln Memorial, the site of her most famous concert, to sing "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" at the 1963 march. In 1939, she performed before a crowd of 75,000 there after the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow her to rent Constitution Hall. Ms. Anderson died April 8 at the age of 96. A memorial service was held at Carnegie Hall in New York in June. Ms. Anderson ended her career at Carnegie Hall in 1965 after a tour of four continents. She received a lifetime achievement Grammy award in 1991.
 
 MAHALIA JACKSON
Gospel singer Mahalia Jackson made many weep during the march when she sang a slave spiritual, "I Been 'Buked and I Been Scorned" to the thousands gathered in front of Lincoln Memorial. Jackson continued to perform in the 1960s, although a heart condition forced her to take a break between 1964 and 1965. She had to cut short a European tour in 1971 because of a heart attack. She died in January 1972 when she was 50.
