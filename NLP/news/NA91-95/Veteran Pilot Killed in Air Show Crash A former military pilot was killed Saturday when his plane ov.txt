Doan, 62, a Daytona Beach restaurateur, was an ex-military pilot who flew numerous aircraft, including AD-4s, between the Korean and Vietnam wars, Quinlan said.
"He apparently had just too much speed at the end of the runway," Quinlan said.
Brevard County sheriff's spokeswoman Joan Heller said the plane flipped nose forward. "The tail came straight up and flopped," she said. No one else was hurt.
Quinlan said the rest of the day's events were canceled, but the final day of the show would go on as scheduled Sunday.
