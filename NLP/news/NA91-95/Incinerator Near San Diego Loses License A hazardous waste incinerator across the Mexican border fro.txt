"The city of Tijuana was growing very fast in very little time, and the plant was located close to the populace," federal Ecology Department spokesman Roberto Contreras told The Associated Press Saturday. "It didn't comply with the requirements, and furthermore, the populace was protesting plenty against this plant."
Ecology Secretary Patricio Chirinos announced the revocation in Tijuana on Thursday.
The plant is part of a larger complex, also operated by Chemical Waste Management, that has been recycling solvents for about three years. That part of the operation will continue, Contreras said.
Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, were widely used to insulate and cool electric transformers until the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned them in the 1970s. The chemicals have been linked to cancer.
