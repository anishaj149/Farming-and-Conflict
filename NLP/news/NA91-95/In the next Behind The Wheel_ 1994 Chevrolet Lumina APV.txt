Someone has been tampering with the quintessential Saab and its timeless, distinctive styling.
Saab aficionados will wince at those words; but early sales of the 1994 Saab 900 5-door hatchback are showing that the changes are welcome.
Out for barely three months, the new 900 hatchback, starting at $ 21,990, is perking up sales at the Swedish car maker, which is now 50 percent owned by General Motors Corp.
In fact, its new V-6 engine comes from a GM plant in Great Britain and its platform is borrowed from a GM Opel.
No matter. The heart and soul of the redesigned 900 is straight from Trollhattan, Sweden. That makes for a fun, yet sensible car that's equally at ease on the switchbacks of Big Cut Road in the California Sierras as in a grocery parking lot in Lansing, Mich.
John C. Kramer, vice president and marketing for Saab Cars USA Inc., said January sales of the 1994 900 5-door model topped last January's combined sales of the 1993 Saab 900 3- and 4-door models.
Indeed, the automaker looks for a healthy, 16 percent boost in sales this year vs. 1993 as it continues to roll out other 900 models. A new 3-door 900 coupe is due in the spring followed by a 900 convertible in the summer. Make no mistake - the 900, with more than 340,000 U.S. sales since it originally came to these shores in 1978, is known as the quintessential Saab.
Still, for 1994 there are plenty of changes. The frumpy, insect-like profile is refined, giving the 900 5-door a more mainstream appearance. The trademark 900 roof crown - where the design lines seem to make the roof look almost like a well-perched add-on - remains, however.
After all, this is no ordinary car roof. It takes a static load of almost three times the weight of the car to collapse the 1994 roof's front corner.
Other safety highlights of the 900 include two standard front air bags, standard antilock brakes and side impact protection that meets 1997 federal government standards.
But there's more. Every one of the five passengers, in front, back and middle, gets three-point lap-and-shoulder safety belts. Everyone, including the middle passenger in the back seat, can have his or her own head rest. Door trim on the 900 5-door is energy-absorbing, and there are foam inserts inside the doors.
Then, there's the 900 ignition key. As in previous Saabs, it isn't on the dashboard or steering column. It's between the two front seats, in the 900 center console, to be exact. It's better there ergonomically, Saab says, and it keeps a driver's knees from slamming into the key during an auto accident.
There also are special Saab crossbeams for the back seat. Both add rigidity, and the top one keeps cargo in the back hatch area from pushing into the passenger compartment during a crash.
Saab adds new "self-restoring" front and rear bumpers, too. In low-speed collisions - under 14 miles an hour - energy-absorbing metal boxes mounted between the bumper supports and the chassis side rails collapse, taking the brunt of the crash force. Saab says that allows easy repair and eliminates chassis realignment work.
But changes aren't limited to safety items. Notable on the 900 5-door is Saab's first six-cylinder engine, a 2.5-liter, four-cam, 54-degree V-6. Capable of 170 horsepower at 5,900 revolutions per minute, it was peppy and responsive in the test car, with good low-end torque.
A new four-speed automatic transmission can be switched from regular to sport mode for more aggressive shifts, but even without the sport mode, the 900 performed well. Unless there's a lot of stop-and-go driving, however, I'd probably prefer the compact five-speed manual. It shifts like a dream.
Average fuel economy in the automatic, by the way, was 23.8 miles a gallon during the test in mixed city and highway driving.
The 900 is a delight on winding mountain roads; acting like a lively billy goat, it bounds from one curve to the next.
That comes from responsive steering and a body with torsional rigidity that Saab says is improved 50 percent from its predecessor model. There's also MacPherson struts up front and a semirigid twist-beam rear axle. Stabilizers bars are found in both front and rear, and the 900 rides on 15-inch tires.
Inside, rear-seat riders will find a good amount of leg room if the front seats are up a ways, but just a few inches remain between the seatbacks and the front edge of the back seats if front seats are back on their tracks all the way.
Competitors are the Toyota Camry sedan, which starts at more than $ 16,400, and the BMW 3-series, which starts at $ 24,675. The base 900 S, with standard 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine starts at $ 21,990. The 900 SE, with standard 2.5-liter V-6, leather seats, power sunroof and premium sound system, starts at $ 26,990.
About 53 percent of Saab 900 buyers are men, with 63 percent between 25 and 44 years of age, the company said. Median household income is $ 81,000, and two-thirds hold professional or managerial jobs. Eighty-two percent have college degrees, and about 70 percent are married.
Because the 900 5-door is a new model, Consumer Reports does not list owner trouble complaints.
