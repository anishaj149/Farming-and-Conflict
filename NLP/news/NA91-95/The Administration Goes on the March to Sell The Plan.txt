On Thursday, the Clinton administration's 30th day in office:
 
 President Clinton flew to St. Louis to begin a selling blitz for his economic program. At a campaign-style rally, he said, "The price of doing the same thing is higher than the price of change."
Other administration officials arranged visits to 28 states to woo public support for the Clinton plan.

In a slap at Clinton's decision to allow people infected with the AIDS virus to immigrate into the United States, the Senate voted to restore the old policy. The White House said Clinton would review his options.
 
 ---
The State Department accused Libya of expanding its chemical weapons capability despite a recently-signed agreement to prohibit such armaments. The department announced steps to cut off outside supplies to the Libyan program.
