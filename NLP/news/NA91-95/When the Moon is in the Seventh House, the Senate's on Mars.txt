Earth date Wednesday, and The World's Greatest Deliberative Body somehow vectored from a debate over a milk-pricing program to a combative reading of the stars.
The argument pitted Sen. Patrick Leahy, Aries-Vt., against Sen. Pete Domenici, Taurus-N.M.
Domenici was trying to neutralize a Leahy amendment the Senate had approved Tuesday requiring processors to pay higher prices for much of the milk they buy from farmers.
Domenici's proposal would have allowed the Agriculture Department to kill the program if it found that the higher prices were forcing the government to reduce its food aid to poor people.
The two lawmakers were trying to outfox each other using Senate rules when Domenici took to the floor to read his horoscope aloud.
"Rules bend in your favor," read Domenici, to the laughter of the entire chamber. "Take charge of your own destiny … stress universal appeal … Aries plays key role."
Leahy strolled over to Domenici, who handed him the newspaper from which he read.
"I'm an Aries," he announced.
He then read his own horoscope.
"Minor crisis erupts, boomerangs in your favor," he read. "Focus on deadline, pressure, responsibility, financial jackpot. Relationship tense but durable. Professional appraisal reveals product worth plenty."
Then he peered, moonstruck, at the paper and said, "This is harder to read but it says, 'The Leahy dairy amendment will survive."'
In the end, the planets aligned with Leahy. The Senate killed Domenici's amendment, 61-39.
