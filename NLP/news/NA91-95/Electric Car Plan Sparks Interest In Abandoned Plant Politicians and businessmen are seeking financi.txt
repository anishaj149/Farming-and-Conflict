Electric Car Plan Sparks Interest In Abandoned Plant  Politicians and businessmen are seeking financing for a plan to convert an abandoned aerospace plant into a center for electric car research and production. The group will ask for $ 8 million in state and federal matching funds for the project, which marks the latest attempt to find new work for the region's fading defense industry, officials announced Friday.

"This is an initial first big step," said Burbank Mayor Michael R. Hastings following a meeting with U.S. Rep. Howard Berman and officials of Lockheed Corp.
Lockheed, which is relocating many of its operations to Palmdale, Calif., and Georgia, would loan a 65,000-square-foot building rent-free for two years to Amerigon Inc., which hopes to make parts for the proposed electric car.
Amerigon, based in suburban Monrovia, is part of CALSTART, a consortium of government and private companies that hope to build a prototype electric vehicle.
The consortium needs $ 20 million to $ 25 million to develop parts and prototypes of electric vehicles, Amerigon President Lon E. Bell said.
In addition to building vehicles that would produce less air pollution, the project would provide a significant economic boost to Burbank, which has lost about 15,000 jobs in recent years.
Scientists, commercial firms and government planners have all cautioned in the past that the electric car industry faces a number of hurdles. The battery-powered vehicles have serious drawbacks, including a limited range, the high initial cost of conversion and slow acceleration.
