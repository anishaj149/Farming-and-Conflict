Soon after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, a few artists galvanized by the civil rights leader's dreams began working together in a rented loft in Harlem. There, they bypassed the downtown galleries that had ignored their work.
It was "a time of great turmoil in the country, great promise, great activity," recalled Kinshasha Holman Conwill, director of what's now known as the Studio Museum.
The idea, she said, was "to have working, living artists in communication with the community."
Twenty-five years later, the Studio Museum in Harlem stands as the nation's first accredited institution devoted entirely to artists of African descent.
The museum's mission is to "collect, preserve, interpret and exhibit the art of black America and the African diaspora," said Conwill, who maintained that it's not - as certain critics might have it - a kind of "misguided affirmative action."
"Harlem has an incredible artistic legacy, and all manner of great thinkers, writers, artists, scholars have lived here, have worked here," including poet Langston Hughes, singers Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, trumpeter Miles Davis and artists Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence, she said. "There must be something in this soil that is nurturing."
The sidewalks near the museum are lined with tables offering African crafts, clothing and sweet potato pie. The latest music blares from portable stereos near stacks of T-shirts, incense and videos for sale.
"We live alongside the utilities, the commercial outlets, the food stores, the churches, the office buildings. We're part of the fabric of the community," Conwill said.
The activists and artists who started the museum in 1968 rented a second-floor loft over a liquor store. In the Harlem Museum, as it was then called, they shared the joy of producing art and the frustration that their work was rarely seen by the general public.
From the beginning, the museum was "pushing the art out there, pushing the artists out there," Conwill said.
In 1981, the museum moved into its present space, a renovated 19th-century building donated by a bank.
Exhibits of the art of Bearden, Lawrence, William T. Williams and William H. Johnson at the Studio Museum have led the way for those artists to gain exposure at such institutions as the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art.
"The museum has trained a generation of administrators and curators who have moved on to other institutions and brought artists from the Studio Museum to the attention of the general public," Williams said. "The museum has been crucial to the development of American art. It has been a dream and a hope fulfilled."
Currently, PaineWebber's corporate headquarters in midtown Manhattan is offering an exhibit of more than 100 works by 60 artists from the museum's collection.
And three artists-in-residence - recipients of one-year, $ 10,000 grants - work in a second-floor studio, continuing the museum's core program of 25 years ago.
The silver anniversary celebration began with an exhibit of the works of Wilfredo Lam, the late Cuban-born painter who was the son of a slave from the Congo and her Chinese husband.
Lam grew up hearing African languages. He studied art in Spain, and fought with the Republican forces in that country's civil war. In the late 1930s, he was painting in Paris, inspired by Picasso, the cubists and the surrealists. Lam's paintings are suffused with the eroticism of surreal tribal symbols - birds, horses, masks equipped with breasts and phallic chins.
In connection with the Lam exhibit, the museum presented a concert of Afro-Caribbean love songs and rumbas, as well as a joint seminar with the Asia Society on "Encounters: The Chinese Diaspora in the Americas."
The Studio Museum's lectures and workshops often explore the music, poetry, film, photography and theater linked to the special exhibits, as well as about 1,400 objects in the permanent collection. While cubism and surrealism grace the walls, some visitors are taught to string beads in Nigerian style.
The private non-profit museum is financed by federal and city grants, as z0000 ----- r z Restart-Message AP DR9600 Text Receiver '2558' (Version 2.00) for DataStream Service a,b,c,f,s,b10q,cenq,gmcq,mamq,9----, 9v800,apmph,apmsg,ohmed,sysop, & g7499 mimi- f n BC-MI--TroubledSchools MichBjt 1 03-06 1333 26 0280 er '2558' (Version 2.00) for DataStream Service New Copy Selection Codes have been programmed.

NEW YORK (AP) - The stock market was surging today, helped by low interest rates and by higher stock prices abroad.
At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 35.67 points at 3,440.25.
Volume on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was 181.89 million shares.
Advancing shares outnumbered declining ones about 11 to 4 on the NYSE, with 1,387 up, 512 down and 550 unchanged.
The NYSE composite index was up 2.67 at 248.67. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up 1.20 at 415.00.
The market received impetus from gains abroad. In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 868.77 points or 5.17 percent. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 35.2 points, or 1.20 percent, to close at a record 2,957.3.
In addition, record low interest rates are helping stocks, as investors look for the best returns on their money. Bond prices were up again today, again pushing down yields.
"Stocks are beginning to look cheap," said Michael Metz, investment strategist with Oppenheimer & Co.
Low interest rates also help corporations, offering them attractive financing costs and a chance to refinance existing, more expensive debt.
A third factor supporting stocks was Friday's strong jobs report for February. The Labor Department reported a jump in nonfarm payrolls - more than twice what economists had expected and an indication of a strong recovery.
"Investors are gaining courage from the good economic reports," said James Melcher, founder and president of Balestra Capital.
In actively traded NYSE issues, Philip Morris was down at 63 1/2. Tobacco stocks have plunged recently under the continuing threat of higher cigarette and alcohol taxes to pay for the Clinton Administration's health-care plans.
Humana, a health-care company, was up at 6 1/2, IBM was up at 55 and Compaq was up 3 at 47 .
Matsushita was up 5 at 93 1/8 and Kyocera was up 3 1/2 at 70 1/2, in part on the strength of the Japanese stock rally.
Park Electrochemical was up 2 at 14 after the stock was recommended by Barron's.
Sensormatic was up 2 1/8 at 37 after music retailers chose the company's electronic antitheft system to guard against theft of compact discs.
On the Amex, Barr Laboratories was up 3 1/8 at 15 after the company said it will receive $ 21 million as part of a settlement of a patent dispute with Imperial Chemical. Crown Craft was down 3 at 15 1/8.
In Nasdaq, over-the-counter trading, TNT Freightways was up 3 1/8 at 23 after an analyst raised its rating on the stock.
