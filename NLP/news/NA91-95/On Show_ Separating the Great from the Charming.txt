Soldiers once sketched their targets in watercolors. Ladies too delicate to garden used them to create their own flower world. And as an exhibit here shows, great artists found them a way to express some of their deepest and most fantastic ideas.
The National Gallery of Art has put up the biggest collection of British watercolors that its director, Earl A. Powell III, can remember.
Andrew Wilton, keeper of the British Collection at London's Tate Gallery, selected the 248 paintings for the exhibit. He said it was aimed to show that great watercolorists were in fact great artists and not just people who made designs for calendars.
So, there are no soldiers' sketches or ladies' depictions of flowers.
Though not organized to include Americans, the exhibit does have four paintings by James McNeill Whistler, who left this country at age of 21 and lived much of his life in Britain.
Paul Sandby was chief draughtsman of the military survey of Scotland set up after the failure of Bonny Prince Charlie's uprising there in 1745. Little of Sandby's military work survives, but there is a military flavor to some of his paintings in the show.
Whistler had a military background, too, but it does not appear in his work. He was discharged from West Point after flunking chemistry and used to joke about it in later life.
Wilton said he and his assistant, Anne Lyles, tried hard to find an appropriate woman artist among the large number of women amateurs and professionals. He considered a Victorian professional named Helen Allingham.
"Her work is excellent," he said. "But it consists - not exclusively, but almost exclusively - of countrywomen holding babies in their arms in front of thatched cottages whose gardens are full of hollyhocks and sunflowers.
"I can only say that we haven't got any thatched cottages in the exhibition. … That wasn't quite what we were aiming at in this show."
Wilton also dismissed Continental watercolor painters of the time.
"There is not the same innovation," he said. "The revolutionary impetus is simply absent. There may be very beautiful watercolors by Continental watercolorists (of the time) but the fact is that none of those artists had the kind of intellectual or technical input that the British were evolving in this period."
Andrew C. Robison, senior curator at the National Gallery, agreed. He said the British watercolorists are superior to even the well-known French oil painters of the period.
Addressing the French artists, Robison said, "Delacroix, Gericault, David, Fragonard, eat your heart out! I think you'll be stunned and amazed at the beauty and the power and the quality of these works as works of art, not as calendar illustrations."
The show, "The Great Age of British Watercolors, 1750-1880," will be at the National Gallery of Art until July 25.
