For one singular moment, a cast of characters representing all the enmity and vision embodied in the search for a Middle East peace came together on one stage.
Arafat. Rabin. Carter. Bush. Kissinger. Peres. The list goes on and on. The spirit of Sadat and Begin was a palpable presence at the White House as well on Monday.
The South Lawn ceremony where Israel and the PLO signed an accord promising self-government for Palestinians brought together many key figures in the long, arduous pursuit of peace. Among them:
- YASSER ARAFAT. In his trademark kaffiyeh and military dress, Arafat for a quarter-century has championed the Palestinian cause. The chairman of the fractious Palestine Liberation Organization represented his side in the secret talks that produced the landmark accord for self-rule of Gaza and the West Bank. "My people are hoping that this agreement … marks the beginning of the end of a chapter of pain and suffering which has lasted throughout this century," he said at the White House ceremony.
- YITZHAK RABIN. The Israeli prime minister is a former military officer who led Israel's armies in conquest of the very lands he now is returning to Palestinian self-rule. He is also a pragmatist, willing to shake hands with his longtime enemy Arafat if it might mean peace. "As our land is small, so must our reconciliation be great," he said. "As our wars have been long, so must our healing be swift."
- JIMMY CARTER. As president, Carter oversaw the negotiation of the 1979 Camp David accord between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat that led to peace between Israel and Egypt. "Not a single word in that peace treaty has ever been violated by the Israelis or the Egyptians," Carter said. "And this has been a clear signal to the other Arabs that you can indeed negotiate with Israel successfully so that both sides win."
- GEORGE BUSH. Bush two years ago helped launch a new round of peace talks in Madrid that got Arabs and Israelis into the habit of talking to one another. While those formal talks made little progress on the Palestinian and Syrian fronts, many believe they paved the way for the secret negotiations in Norway that produced the self-rule accord.
- HENRY KISSINGER. Using the standoff in the 1973 Mideast war as a springboard, Richard Nixon's and Gerald Ford's secretary of state used "shuttle diplomacy" to produce interim agreements between Israel and its two major Arab adversaries, Egypt and Syria. Carter seized on those accomplishments to produce the Camp David accord. Kissinger calls the latest peace treaty "the best hope for peace that has existed. … I think it will be very tough and we shouldn't be too euphoric."
- SHIMON PERES. Working quietly, the Israeli foreign minister managed to hold more than a dozen secret negotiating sessions with PLO officials - some of those sessions in violation of Israeli law - to produce the outline of the agreement on Palestinian self rule. "What we are going today is more than signing an agreement, it is a revolution," he said. "Yesterday a dream, today a commitment."
- JOHAN JORGEN HOLST. The Norwegian foreign minister brokered the secret negotiations that produced the self-rule agreement. Holst, who took office in April, now is mentioned as a possible prospect for the Nobel Peace Prize. "What we tried to do was to create a human dimension to negotiations," he said. "We tried to get a small group of people together, feel comfortable, be together in a group, work for a common end."
