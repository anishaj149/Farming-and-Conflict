Here is a review of the Persian Gulf crisis as it unfolded, in the words statesmen, soldiers and ordinary people:
 
 "We have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait."
-Reported remark of U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in late July.
 
 "The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!"
-A Kuwaiti official shouting in a telephone interview Aug. 2, after the invasion.
 
 "Iraq is pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations with Kuwait. Furthermore, it is the Kuwaitis themselves who will determine their own future and Iraqi forces will withdraw as soon as order has been restored."
-Iraqi U.N. diplomat Sabah Talat Kadrat, Aug. 2.
 
 "A line has been drawn in the sand."
-President Bush on sending U.S. forces to defend Saudi Arabia from possible Iraqi invasion, Aug. 8.
 
 "Burn the soil under the feet of the aggressors and invaders. … Hit their interests wherever they are, rescue holy Mecca and rescue the grave of the prophet."
-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Aug. 10, urging Moslems to unite in opposition to U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
 
 "I just put it to you: What does it look like? What does it sound like? This reminds me of the 1930s, and we have learned from history."
-Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Aug. 10.
 
 "Let no one doubt: We will not rule out a possible use of force if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait."
-Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Oct. 30.
 
 "If war is imposed upon us by the United States, this will be our destiny. Our people will not kneel, we will rise to this responsibility."
-Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Nov. 29.
 
 "I did not close the embassy, but I vacated it. The flag flies."
-Nathaniel Howell, U.S. ambassador to Kuwait, after leaving the Iraqi-occupied nation, Dec. 14.
 
 "No. I'm not ready to do the job."
-Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller, deputy commander of Operation Desert Shield, saying Dec. 20 that U.S. troops would not be fully prepared for combat by the Jan. 15 deadline.
 
 "We are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are called upon to do."
-White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, responding to Waller's statement, Dec. 20.
 
 "No negotiations, no compromise, no attempts at face-saving and no rewards for aggression. What there will be if Iraq accepts this offer is simply and importantly an opportunity to resolve this crisis peacefully."
-President Bush, Jan. 3.
 
 "Nobody wants a war. They're showing our servicemen and women on television, waving and laughing and saying 'Hi, Mom, Hi, Dad,' and in two weeks they could be coming home in body bags. It's crazy."
-Sunny Weilblinger, a Colorado waitress, Jan. 5.
 
 "This was a total stiff-arm, a total rebuff."
