1. U.N. Team To Build Plant For Destruction Of Chemical Arms U.N. experts traveled to Iraq Sunday to survey progress on the construction of an incinerator to dispose of chemical weapons as part of the drive to destroy Iraq's military might.Iran's weapons of mass destruction are being destroyed under the supervision of the United Nations and in accordance with the cease-fire that ended the Gulf War.Last month, Iraq averted a possible Western military attack when it backed down from its previous insistence that its missile-production facilities be converted to civilian use rather than dismantled.

2. Protesters Occupy U.N. Mission in New York For Two Hours Five demonstrators took over the Iranian Mission to the United Nations for two hours Sunday, holding three employees hostage in protest of Iran's attack on a rebel base in Iraq, police said.Two of the hostages were freed almost immediately by police officers who broke through a rear door of the mission, said David Scott, a department chief with the police.
