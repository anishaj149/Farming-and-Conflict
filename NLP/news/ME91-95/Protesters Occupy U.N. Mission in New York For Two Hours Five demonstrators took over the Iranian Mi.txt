Mission in New York For Two Hours  Five demonstrators took over the Iranian Mission to the United Nations for two hours Sunday, holding three employees hostage in protest of Iran's attack on a rebel base in Iraq, police said. Two of the hostages were freed almost immediately by police officers who broke through a rear door of the mission, said David Scott, a department chief with the police.

The third was released when the unarmed protesters surrendered peacefully shortly after 3:30 p.m., Scott said.
No one was hurt, but furniture, televisions and computers were smashed and the mission's walls were sprayed with paint, police and protesters said.
Hundreds of demonstrators stormed Iranian embassies and consulates across Europe and North America in similar protests of Iran's air raid on a base of the National Liberation Army near Baghdad.
The army is the military wing of the Mujahedeen Khalq, the largest Iranian exile opposition group. The group, whose name means People's Holy Warriors, demanded the United Nations impose an oil, weapons and air embargo on Iran.
The five people in New York were jailed and scheduled for arraignment in federal court Monday on charges of violating the Protection of Foreign Officials Act, said Sgt. Mary Wrensen, a police spokeswoman.
