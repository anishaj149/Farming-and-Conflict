A 13-year-old Michigan boy who hopes to be president someday won the 1995 National Geography Bee by correctly guessing the landlocked central Asian country where Pashtu and Dari are spoken.
Chris Galeczka, an eighth-grader at Bemis Junior High School in the Detroit suburb of Sterling Heights, beat Aaron Wenzel, 14, an eighth-grader at Freeport Junior High School in Freeport, Ill., in the final round of the seventh annual contest sponsored by the National Geographic Society.
Both boys were asked to write the answer to the question: "Pashtu and Dari are the languages of which mountainous, landlocked country in central Asia?"
Chris correctly answered Afghanistan; Aaron incorrectly guessed Bhutan.
Before that, both boys had outlasted eight other competitors during seven excruciating rounds dealing with rivers, land masses, the crafts of indigenous peoples and politics. Altogether, nearly six million students competed in this year's bee.
"Lots of the questions come from the magazine," Chris said. "So if you read that, you know a lot of the stuff."
Chris, who won a $ 25,000 college scholarship, has not yet decided which college he wants to attend, and he wouldn't outline his plans to become president. "My grandma told me not to be political," he said.
Chris, who likes to boat, snowmobile, watch TV and play with his computer, reads newspapers and magazines intently. Foreign policy issues are his favorites, and he's thought deeply about some problems President Clinton faces.
Asked by game show host Alex Trebek what he thought the United States should do about Bosnia, Chris called the problem "complex."
"I'd say we should work with other countries," he told Trebek.
