Cowboy movies have been favorites of film-goers throughout the world ever since the first silent picture depicted heroes of the American "Wild West" almost a century ago.
With that in mind, the Maldives (a former British protectorate in the Indian Ocean) issued a sheetlet of eight vertical stamps illustrating scenes from some of the wonderful Westerns.
Shown on the sheetlet are: Jimmy Stewart and Marlene Dietrich from the 1939 "Destry Rides Again," Gary Cooper in the 1940 movie "The Westerner," Henry Fonda in a scene from the 1946 "My Darling Clementine," Alan Ladd in the 1953 "Shane," Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster in the 1957 film "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral," Steve McQueen in the 1960 "The Magnificent Seven," Robert Redford and Paul Newman in the 1969 "Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid," Jack Nicholson and Randy Quaid in the 1976 opus "The Missouri Breaks."
Two souvenir sheets also were released by the Maldives. One shows a movie poster of the 1985 film "Pale Rider" starring Clint Eastwood plus photos of old time popular movie cowboys Bronco Billie, William S. Hart, Tom Mix and Will Rogers. The second souvenir sheet has a poster featuring John Wayne in the 1956 movie "The Searchers."

Israel Hails Hebrew Films
Speaking of tributes to the motion picture industry, Israel has issued three new stamps dedicated to "75 Years of Hebrew Films."
In 1911 the first Zionist film was shot in Palestine showing scenes of the country to be viewed at the 10th Zionist Congress in Basil, Switzerland.
However, this was not considered a "Hebrew Film" since it did not have the Hebrew language, producers or plot, says the Israel Postal Authority and Philatelic Service in Jerusalem.
The first full Hebrew film was produced in 1918 entitled "Judah Liberated."
In commemoration of the 75th anniversary, Israel has released a trio of stamps with tabs honoring "Judah Liberated," "Oded the Wanderer," and the first full-length picture "This Is The Land." The tab on each stamp indicates the date the movie was first screened.
