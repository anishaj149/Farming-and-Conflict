Washington scrambled today to keep Iraq's missile raid from triggering a retaliatory strike by Israel and a consequent Arab walkout from the United Nations coalition at war against Saddam Hussein.
The Iraqi president's strike at Israel - and a single, U.S.-foiled attempt to also hit Saudi Arabia with a missile - put to rest widespread bafflement over the Iraqi leader's feeble initial response to two of the heaviest days of bombardment in history.
President Bush condemned Saddam's pre-dawn raids on Tel Aviv and Haifa and struck back with a new wave of bombings in Iraq. Secretary of State James A. Baker III consulted with the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria - three key Arab partners in the drive to isolate Saddam.
Bush, while working to keep the coalition assembled, planned to visit the Pentagon this afternoon before spending the weekend at Camp David, Md.
A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the allies understood that Israel would retaliate for the missile attack.
The Israeli ambassador to Washington, Zalman Shoval, said only that "Israel reserves the right to respond in any way it deems fit."
The White House said Baker assured Israel that the United States would act "to eliminate this threat."
Before the war began, the administration sought Israel's assurances it would stay on the sidelines, but Israel insisted on the right to defend itself.
Even if militarily insignificant, Saddam's strike foretold potentially damaging political consequences. Israeli retaliation could cause Muslim and Arab allies to pull out of the 28-nation coalition seeking to enforce the resolutions of the United Nations.
Such a development would enhance Saddam's claim as a leader of the Arab masses. Thoroughly outgunned, he has attempted from the start to reshape the conflict over his occupation of Kuwait into an Arab-Israel confrontation in which ever Arab state would be under pressure to back him.
Iraq's attack - though less damaging than first thought - "could seriously change the equation," said Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. "And it could certainly, depending on the seriousness if the Israelis respond, put considerable strain on the coalition."
But Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who fought in Congress last week to give Bush authority to go to war, said he didn't expect the coalition to dissolve.
"Both Egypt and Saudi Arabia fully understand that Iraq is much more of a threat to them than Israel," Solarz said.
Meantime, the Pentagon awaited word on the results of Thursday night's ferocious attacks against Iraqi targets, intended in part to destroy Saddam's ability to communicate with his army - and thus to isolate and demoralize the troops.
So pleased were U.S. military planners with the results of Thursday's 1,300 aerial missions that both Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney felt constrained to warn that dark days could lie ahead.
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reported that Bush cautioned his Cabinet that "things might not go so well" in the days ahead.
Said Cheney: "There have been casualties and there are likely to be more casualties."
Still, members of Congress rose to cheer when Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went to the Capitol to report on the first results of the war. The Senate congratulated the armed forces by a vote of 98-0.
"People continue to be awed and thrilled by the skill of our military and the effectiveness of our weapons," said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
And from a leader of last week's Senate doves, Tom Harkin, D-Iowa: "I have to hand it to them."
Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., offered this assessment of Saddam's failure to respond vigorously to the air raids on his forces: "I think it's paralysis. They aren't communicating anymore."
Senators were told 80 percent of targets were actually hit - a high success ratio.
Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., marveled at how forces from at least four countries could fly so many missions in such a constricted space without even a common language, yet emerge with "no mishaps, no accidents."
"There's never been this assimilation, this combining of massive air and other power since D-Day in Normandy," said Dickinson, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee.
Even Bush, his face no longer etched in the grimness of the last few days, reflected pleasure in the success of allied bombers.
Before word came of Iraq's strike, the president playfully joshed with Fitzwater. He taunted his press secretary with mock ire for having suggested that Saddam's "surrender" was the ultimate goal of Operation Desert Storm.
Actually, its stated purpose remains Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
