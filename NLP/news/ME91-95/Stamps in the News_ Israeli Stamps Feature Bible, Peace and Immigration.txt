Children's drawings of Bible stories, the Mideast peace process and immigration are the themes of three new issuances by Israel.
Every few years, the Israel Philatelic Service releases stamps based on children's drawings. In the past, these stamps have been devoted to subjects such as peace, the city of Jerusalem and road safety.
This year's stamps are taken from an exhibition, "Children and Young People Draw The Bible," which was shown in Tel Aviv in 1990. The drawings for the four stamps were chosen from the work of sixth-graders in the Golda Meir School in Holon.
The winners were: Moses in the Bulrushes" by Carmit Crspi, "Adam and Eve" by Itai Cohen, "Jacob's Dream" by Moran Sheinberg, and "The Parting of the Red Sea" by Avital Kaisar.
The Peace Process stamps, as previously announced, feature a house divided into two parts. One side for the Arabs shows an Oriental window above which is a crescent in relief and the other side displays a window over which is the Star of David.
The pair of stamps with the theme of immigration to Israel (known by the Hebrew name of Aliyot) depicts scenes of people arriving in large numbers.
The stamps are available from the Israel Collectors Society, P.O. Box 917, Van Nuys, Calif. 91408, for $ 15.95, first-day covers for $ 25.95; both for $ 39.95.
Collectors of Israeli stamps can purchase a copy of the new revised edition of the complete Israel Postage Stamp Catalog for $ 49.95 plus $ 2 each for postage from the ISCS.

U.S. Post Office Also Hails Locomotives
In 1994, the U.S. Postal Service also paid philatelic tribute to old locomotives. The USPS commented on the train release: "steam engines (like the ones shown in the set) once knit the country together with threads of steel." The romance of railroads in the United States was captured in five 29-cent stamps, available in booklet form.
