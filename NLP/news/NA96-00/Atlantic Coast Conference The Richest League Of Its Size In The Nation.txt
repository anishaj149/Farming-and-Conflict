The Atlantic Coast Conference has produced dozens of national champions in the athletic arena. On financial ledgers, the league has played itself into even more exclusive company.
Internal Revenue Service reports obtained by The Associated Press show the nine-member ACC generated $ 50.8 million in the 1994-95 academic year, the latest period for which records are available.
The total is more than any other league that has 10 or less member schools, and it is the second-highest among the NCAA's 10 Division I-A athletic conferences. Only the 12-school Southeastern Conference, with $ 54.6 million in revenues, generated more.
The IRS figures show not all the major conferences operate in the black. The Big Ten operated at a deficit of more than $ 56,000 in 1994-95, and the Pacific-10 lost $ 246,933 that year.
"We've been very fortunate," ACC commissioner Eugene F. Corrigan said, "but we've also had a very gifted group of people working to make this happen, especially at the schools. The athletic directors, coaches and student-athletes are the ones who should get most of the credit."
The ACC has produced 45 individual NCAA champions as well as national titles from 18 women's and 10 men's teams since Corrigan became commissioner more than eight years ago.
Corrigan's role in selling that product includes negotiating lucrative television contracts and bowl deals that have helped secure the long-term financial health of the ACC.
While the major conferences all enjoy tax-exempt status because they are classified as educational organizations, they have different approaches to sharing their revenues with members.
For example, the ACC gave back 90 percent of its 1994-95 revenues to member schools, kept a relatively small amount to run the conference office and ended the year with an excess of $ 762,866.
The SEC gave back 76 percent and ended the year with an excess of $ 5.2 million, boosting the total in its coffers to $ 16.6 million.
The ACC's nine faculty representatives, who make many of the major decisions for the league, have determined that it is prudent for the conference office to retain an amount equal to twice its annual budget. Such a practice helps create a nest egg that could be used in various ways, including capital projects and to help schools finance membership in another league if the ACC were to ever disband.
The ACC finished 1994-95 with total assets of $ 7.04 million, but some of that helped finance the 11,000-square-foot, $ 1.4 million headquarters the league is building in another Greensboro neighborhood.
The bulk of the ACC's revenues were generated by basketball. The conference's television contract produced $ 15.98 million, the NCAA tournament generated another $ 10.80 million and the ACC tournament made $ 3.41 million.
The ACC made $ 9.88 million in football television revenues and $ 8.76 million from bowl games.
The television revenue figures are somewhat deceiving, however, because 1994-95 was the last year of the league's old TV package. Most of the ACC's games were televised through Jefferson Pilot, but the league also had selected games broadcast by ESPN and ABC.
The ACC is in the first year of five-year contracts with ESPN and ABC for both football and basketball, deals that league sources said will eventually pay out more for football than for basketball.
The ACC distributes funds to members based on a complicated formula that includes television appearances and bowl games.
Florida State received the biggest payout - $ 5.63 million - from the ACC in 1994-95. The lowest - $ 4.51 million - went to Georgia Tech.
