In all the election-night mayhem, there are several states and individual races that offer a glimpse into national trends - from the fight for the White House and Congress to whether Christian conservatives or organized labor get the upper hand in turning out voters in targeted contests.
Here are 10 races or places to watch:
-KENTUCKY: Even with a win over President Clinton in this tossup state, Republican challenger Bob Dole would have a long way to go for his upset. But Dole cannot afford to lose the state. Down ballot, a GOP win over Democratic Rep. Mike Ward would calm House Speaker Newt Gingrich's nerves about his leadership post and dampen Democratic chances of retaking the House.
-GEORGIA: Another must-win for Dole, and a pivotal state in the battle for the Senate. Democrat Sam Nunn is retiring, and Republican Guy Milner had late momentum in a tight race. Democrats need to gain three seats to win the Senate; losing here would make the climb steeper.
-OHIO: The polls close at 7:30 p.m. EST, and by then Dole will know if he has a prayer. No Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio. Democrats hope to defeat GOP Reps. Martin Hoke in suburban Cleveland and Frank Cremeans in the state's more conservative southeast corner. These are critical tests of the $ 35 million AFL-CIO campaign to put the House back in Democratic hands.
-NORTH CAROLINA SENATE: Four-term GOP Sen. Jesse Helms in a rematch with 1990 Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt, who is black and a former Charlotte mayor. Race was again an issue in the end. Helms never wins by much, and is banking on high Christian conservative turnout. "We need this seat to have a realistic shot of getting the Senate back," says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman.
-FLORIDA: Until a tightening of the presidential race in the final week, Clinton aides were picturing an electoral landslide - in part because of the Democrat's lead in this usually Republican presidential state. A Clinton win here "and the so-called Republican lock on the Electoral College is shattered," said Clinton deputy campaign manager Ann Lewis. The Tampa-area seat of retiring Democratic Rep. Sam Gibbons is a GOP target.
-ARKANSAS SENATE: Clinton's homestate factors big in Republicans' hopes to increase their 53-47 Senate majority. GOP Rep. Tim Hutchinson led late in the race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. David Pryor. Democrat Winston Bryant hoped for Clinton coattails.
-NEW HAMPSHIRE: Democratic state Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was favored to become the state's first woman governor - and the first Democrat elected to that job since 1980. Republican Bob Smith, an anti abortion leader in the U.S. Senate, was in a tough race against former Rep. Dick Swett as Democrats looked to break the state's GOP tradition up and down the ballot.
-ARIZONA: Not since Harry Truman in 1948 has a Democrat carried this state in a presidential race, a marker Clinton had high hopes of shattering until the race tightened late. One of several Western states where Ross Perot's count could make a difference in the outcome. Freshman GOP Rep. J.D. Hayworth was one of labor's top targets, and was struggling to hold his seat.
-WASHINGTON: The defeat of then-House Speaker Thomas Foley headlined the 1994 Republican rout here. The six House seats gained by Republicans two years ago are the major battlegrounds, and late Republican momentum appeared to dampen Democratic hopes for a big swing back in their favor. Democrat Gary Locke was favored to become the first Chinese American governor of a mainland state.
-CALIFORNIA: At the start of the campaign year, Republicans suggested affirmative action would be a major national issue. It wasn't, in part because of the popularity of retired Gen. Colin Powell, who declared himself a Republican and warned his new party against focusing on affirmative action, and because of Dole's decision to put the GOP's ambassador of minority outreach, Jack Kemp, on the GOP ticket. Dole did return to the issue during his late California push.
Like an anti-immigration ballot question two years ago, some Republicans believe the anti-affirmative action initiative on the California ballot this year will increase conservative turnout. The results are likely to go a long way in shaping future debate on the issue.
