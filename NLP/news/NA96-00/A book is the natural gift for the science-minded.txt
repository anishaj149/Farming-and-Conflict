Does someone on your holiday gift list have a passion for science or nature?
Well, you needn't be a rocket scientist to figure out that the natural gift might be a book.
With topics ranging from Mars to machines, and wildlife to wildflowers, one of these bright, glossy, richly illustrated volumes could provide just the right chemistry.

'Wildlife of North America' (Hugh Lauter Levin, $ 75) by Thomas A. Lewis
You'll need an extra hand or a table to hold this book while you turn its pages. It opens to 33 inches wide to reveal 150 color photos displaying the diversity of North American wildlife. Species range from the pygmy shrew, which weighs less than an ounce, to the 200-ton blue whale, in habitats as diverse as the sizzling desert and frozen Arctic. Among the images: a white-tailed fawn inspects a monarch butterfly among pink flowers in a Montana wilderness reserve; horned puffins meet to mate on a rock ledge in Alaska; a bison nuzzles her calf in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming; and in Mexico, a lesser long-nosed bat hovers over a saguaro cactus flower before sipping its nectar.

'The New Way Things Work' (Houghton Mifflin, $ 35) by David McCaulay
Things don't always work, but this book shows you how they work when they do work. It also shows how the concept of one machine can be linked to the concept of another: for example, dentists' drills are related to windmills, and zippers to the Pyramids. This popular book has been updated and expanded from the 1988 edition to include computers and their peripherals. Text and drawings describe the inner workings of hundreds of things and processes, from light bulbs to lenses, cruise control to remote control, and vending machines to VCRs (but no hints about how to program one).

'Mars: Uncovering the Secrets of the Red Planet' (National Geographic Society, $ 40) by Paul Raeburn
Two pairs of glasses (who'd want to go to Mars alone?) are provided for viewing the book's 3-D photos, including the four-page spread of the Sojourner rover prowling Mars' terrain after Pathfinder landed in July 1997. Along with 125 conventional photos, there is a foreword and commentary by Matt Golombek, chief scientist on the Pathfinder mission. Text delves into our fascination with Mars, the race against the Soviet Union to reach Mars first, and theories about future exploration of Mars.

'The Metamorphosis of Flowers' (Abrams, $ 39.95) by Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou
A close-up look at the lives of wildflowers, from bud through unfolding petals to full bloom, and to fading, shrinking and the fall of the corolla. More than 100 color photos study 17 species, among them cornflower, buttercup, dandelion, daisy, iris and poppy. Also, a poetic mediation on flowers and their meaning throughout history, and information about each species.

'Rainforests of the World' (Crown, $ 45) by Art Wolfe
Text by Sir Ghillean Prance accompanies more than 200 color photos by nature photographer Wolfe. Rainforests are home to more than half the world's species, and this book explains and celebrates the world's rainforests and the plants, animals and people that inhabit them. Among the photos: a slow loris clings to a vine in Borneo; fallen red petals from a canon-ball tree brighten the forest floor; in Central America, a red-eyed tree frog surveys the scene; and two young scarlet macaws perch above a river in Peru.

'Chased by the Light' (NorthWord, $ 35) by Jim Brandenburg
Brandenburg strolled the forest near his home in Minnesota every day for 90 days, from the first day of autumn to the first day of winter, and challenged himself to take only one photo per day - and make it a good one. This album is a diary of those 90 days. Images include loons swimming, a timber wolf dining on its catch, the black spruce forest, an approaching storm, a woodpecker at work, frozen waterfalls, the Aurora borealis.
