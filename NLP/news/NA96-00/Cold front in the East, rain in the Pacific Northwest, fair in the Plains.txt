A cold front with gusty winds pushed toward the mid-Atlantic states Tuesday while the Plains had fair skies and the Pacific Northwest had windy, wet weather.
The cold front cleared out of the Northeast, although some lingering rain showers fell over New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
Skies were fair to partly cloudy in the area. The front was headed south to the mid-Atlantic region and the Tennessee Valley.
There was fair and dry weather over the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.
Scattered showers fell over Florida and there was a chance of a few thunderstorms.
Fair and mild weather was found over much of the Plains, with temperatures ranging from the 30s and 40s over the Dakotas and Minnesota to the 60s and 70s over Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas.
Low pressure swirled near the Washington coast, a storm that produced strong and gusty wind over western Washington. Rain showers were scattered over lower elevations of Washington and Oregon.
Farther east, rain and snow showers were falling over areas of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Winds were quite gusty along the Front Range of the Rockies in Montana.
Farther south, fair to partly cloudy skies were seen over the Southwest and southern Rockies.
In the continental United States, temperatures ranged from a midday high of 84 in Fort Myers, Fla., to a low of 13 in Gunnison, Colo. The highest heat index was 86 in Sarasota, Fla., the lowest wind chill was zero in Crookston, Minn., and the highest wind gust was 67 mph in Whidbey Island, Wash.
