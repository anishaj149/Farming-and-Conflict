Americans on the unresolved presidential race between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush:
-"I felt that my vote didn't matter. Now I know I do count." Nashville, Tenn., waitress Dottie Condrey, 51, who did not vote.
-"I could not believe it. We need an answer." Robin Tigges, of Revere, Mass.
-"At 10 p.m. it was Gore. Then I fell asleep and woke up around midnight and it was Bush. Then this morning it's no one. The whole thing was pretty screwy." Veronica Rucker, Pennsauken, N.J.
-"Oh please. It's ridiculous." Wayne Silva, a construction supervisor from Windsor, Conn., on the prospect of waiting days for the outcome.
-"I kept waking up at 3, 4 o'clock, saying, 'OK, when is the nightmare going to be over?' I'm shocked that it's still not decided." Janet Neale, Baltimore addictions counselor.
-"I'm a Democrat all the way. But now, I won't be disappointed if Bush wins. I pray about it and it's in the Lord's hands." Catline Swift in Crawford, Texas, near Bush's ranch.
-"I thought to myself, 'It's going to be a long month."' Richard Azuero, 32, a Denver, Colo., independent who voted for Bush.
-"I hope they count correctly and I hope they count quickly." Jane Reznicek, 37, of Chicago, an independent who voted for Gore.
-"I didn't sleep well. Still not hearing makes me nervous." Kevin Seamans, 30, Salt Lake City.
-"So we don't have a president. So what? We didn't before." Bob Jensen, 78, Salt Lake City.
-"I stayed up clicking on the Internet watching Florida, Iowa and Wisconsin until the networks declared for Bush. I tossed and turned trying to get to sleep. It was unsettling. But I was pleasantly surprised this morning." John Evans, 54, of Golden, Colo., who voted for Gore.
-"I did my duty. I voted. What happens, happens." Jim McClintock, Cedar Falls, Iowa.
-"I'm a businessman and I stick with that. One or the other, I'm still going to be here, working to make a living." Sal Antinoro, 65, a pizza shop owner in Trenton, N.J., who voted for Gore but paid no attention to the TV or radio Wednesday morning.
-"I got up this morning and my eyes were glued to the TV. I was wondering who paid who off. … In Louisiana, it's common to grease palms." Angela Kampen, a French Quarter bartender in New Orleans, on hearing about a possible ballot mix-up in Palm Beach County, Fla.
