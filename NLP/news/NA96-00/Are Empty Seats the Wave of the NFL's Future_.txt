No one tuned to Monday night's game in Atlanta could miss it: Al, Dan and Frank wisecracking about the thousands of empty seats for the 49ers-Falcons game. There were 46,318 people in the 71,228-seat Georgia Dome, and a lot fewer after halftime.
"There's got to be more than 40,000 football fans in Atlanta," said Bob Whitfield, the Falcons' left tackle. "Whether they like us or not, they can come out just to heckle us. I would just appreciate having people in the stands."
Whitfield's not the only one who's noticed.
After 14 weeks, NFL attendance is down - not markedly, but perceptibly.
An average of 60,956 fans have paid for tickets to each of the 196 games played through last Sunday, down 1,569 a game or 2.5 percent from this time last season.
But that doesn't take into account no-shows, like the 55,985 empty seats at Giants Stadium last Sunday to watch the 1-12 New York Jets lose to Houston.
Houston is used to such things.
Two weeks ago, just 20,107 turned up at the Astrodome to watch the Oilers lose to Carolina, a result of the Oilers' announced and approved move to Tennessee. That's probably the difference between Houston making the playoffs and missing them - 2-4 at home, 5-2 on the road so far this season, meaning the Oilers would be a lot better than 7-6 if they had any home support.
Houston and Atlanta are two of the teams with serious attendance problems, according to figures compiled by the Sports Business Daily.
They also demonstrate the two main causes of declining attendance, franchise free agency and poor performance. The latter has always been with the NFL, the former is new.
Oakland, for example, is averaging 52,601 fans at the newly renovated 62,500-seat Coliseum. Before the Raiders moved to Los Angeles in 1982, they usually sold out.
One reason is permanent seat licenses in a blue-collar town. In two years, 35,000 have been sold at prices ranging from $ 250 to $ 4,000 per seat, 9,000 fewer than the break-even point.
Cincinnati, down 3,000 per game, is an example of a team with both problems. The Bengals started 1-6 and ticket sales were slow, because the team's future in the city was in doubt until voters in a referendum earlier this year approved construction of a new stadium.
But some owners think the instability of the past few years has made some fans nervous.
"I think there's perception that we're scaring the average fan out of the stadium," says Ralph Wilson, owner of the Buffalo Bills.
The NFL office looks at it as a cycle, noting that for the past seven seasons, total attendance (exhibitions, regular season, playoffs) has increased each time. "You'll always get drops when teams do poorly on the field," says NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.
Still, it's not only money at the gate, it's money for parking, concessions and other items that isn't coming in.
The Jets, for example, are one of eight teams that have lost money at the box office this season, a relatively minor $ 216,133, according to Sports Business Daily. New Orleans, Atlanta, Arizona, Tampa Bay and Houston, all down more than $ 1 million, are the big losers.
But those nearly 56,000 fans who didn't show up at the Meadowlands last week also didn't pay to park or for hot dogs and beer.
So it may not be a problem now. But it also does not bode well for the future.

THE WORM TURNS: "Until the AFC wins a Super Bowl, there will always be the perception that the NFC is the superior conference," says John Elway, whose goal this season is leading Denver to the AFC's first Super Bowl victory in 13 years.
For whatever it's worth, there are signs that the AFC indeed is the superior conference.
So far this season, the AFC's top four teams - Denver, Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Kansas City - are 13-0 in interconference competition. Some of those are over NFC contenders - Buffalo over Dallas, Washington and Philadelphia, and Kansas City over Green Bay.
All three remaining games figure to be tough for the AFC. Denver is at Green Bay on Sunday, and Pittsburgh is home for San Francisco and visits Carolina the final two weeks.
Still, the pendulum finally seems to be swinging.
"For a long time, I think we've been the deeper conference," says Elway, who quarterbacked Denver in Super Bowl losses to the Giants, Redskins and 49ers by a combined score of 136-40.
"But there have always been two or three teams at the top of the NFC who were dominant. I'm not sure that's the case any more."

SMASHMOUTH: Even in their Super Bowl years, the New York Giants were never known for the quality of their wide receivers. They haven't had a wideout in the Pro Bowl since Homer Jones in 1968.
So it's really no surprise that if Chris Calloway, currently their leading receiver with 48 catches, leads the team this season, it will be the first time since Del Shofner in 1963 that a wide receiver has led the team outright in receiving for two straight years.
In 1977 and 1978, Jimmy Robinson, a wide receiver, was the team leader, but he shared it the second season with Johnny Perkins. The first year shouldn't count - Robinson's team-leading figure was 22.
Tight end Mark Bavaro, a legitimate All-Pro, led the Giants in 1986 and 1987.
Bavaro had 1,019 yards receiving in '86, the year of the first Super Bowl victory. The last Giants wide receiver with a 1,000-yard season was Lionel Manuel in 1988 with 1,029.
This season, Calloway trailed Thomas Lewis until Lewis missed the last two games with a pulled hamstring. Lewis, who has 43 catches, is questionable again for this week, which makes Calloway's record more likely.
