Those with a strong need to watch Olympic figure skating from the luxury of a suite can fulfill their wish - for $154,000.
That's the going rate the Delta Center is charging to rent the 22-seat suites for 10 sessions of figure skating and four sessions of short-track speedskating.
A 32-seat suite also is available for $268,800.
Demand for the pricey seats already has begun.
About 80 percent of the suites available at the Delta Center, the E Center and the University of Utah Rice-Eccles Stadium during the 2002 Winter Olympics have been rented.
Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt Romney said the high prices for the suites means cheaper tickets for everyone else.
"It's very simple," he said. "We will charge what the market will bear for luxury suites. At the same time, we will be able to provide many low-priced tickets."
An SLOC brochure says a suite at the Delta Center includes "great views of the arena … luxury furnishings, a television, telephone and private facilities."
Springing for a suite that seats 20 at the E Center for all 30 men's hockey games costs up to $230,000.
A 16-seat suite for the opening and closing ceremonies at Rice-Eccles Stadium is priced at $120,000 for both nights. A 24-seat suite costs $170,000.
Although there will be no charge to attend the medal ceremonies at a downtown parking lot owned by a church, the organizing committee is selling suites there, too.
Twenty-five people will be able to share a suite for each of the 15 nightly awards ceremonies for $92,500.
"Anybody can buy them," SLOC spokeswoman Caroline Shaw said.
