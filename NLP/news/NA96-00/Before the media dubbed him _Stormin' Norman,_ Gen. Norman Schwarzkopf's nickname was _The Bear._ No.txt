Schwarzkopf, national spokesman for a grizzly bear recovery campaign, visited Yellowstone National Park on Friday to see how a high-tech satellite system is being used to track grizzlies in the wild.
"I'm very much interested in anything having to do with grizzly bears in the Lower 48," he said, while watching a female grizzly and three cubs on a nearby mountain ridge.
"I want to see them survive as a symbol of the American wilderness."
The program is using the Global Positioning System to keep tabs on bear numbers and movement.
Four special radio collars, at a cost of $ 5,000 each, will be placed around the necks of four adult female grizzlies. Collar transmissions are picked up by GPS, a network of military tracking satellites.
Scientists used to fly over the park to keep tabs on grizzlies.
"Instead of having to fly, now we just get a printout," said Kerry Gunther, Yellowstone's grizzly management coordinator.
