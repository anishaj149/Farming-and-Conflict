"Winnie the Pooh," the famous bear featured in children's classic stories by A.A. Milne, is heralded in a new set of four stamps by Canada.
The real life Winnie was a female black bear born in the province of Ontario in Canada before World War I. She was purchased by Lt. Harry Colebourn of the Canadian Army during that war. Colebourn took Winnie with him to England with the troops and placed the bear in the London Zoo for safekeeping.
Milne, editor of Punch magazine, visited the zoo. He and his son took a liking to Winnie, and in 1926 published the first of the children's books featuring Winnie and her friends.
In 1961 Walt Disney produced a series of Winnie the Pooh films and TV shows. The Milne books still are favorites with youngsters today.
The four 45-cent stamps released by Canada Post depict various views of Winnie and friends. The stamps were issued as part of October's "Stamp Collecting Month" in Canada.
You may order these stamps directly from Canada Post Corp., 2701 Riverside Dr., Suite E070, Ottawa, Canada, ON K1A 081, or phone (800) 565-4362.

More Classic Cars
In the past, the U.S. Postal Service also issued stamps featuring classic cars. Francis Edgar Stanley, inventor of the well-known "Stanley Steamer," was honored on the 1985 Transportation coil stamp. The 12-cent stamp pictured the classic car as the main illustration.
Henry Clayton Stutz, whose Stutz Bearcat won most of the auto races in the United States for the first two years of its existence, was also hailed on the 1985 Transportation coil stamp. The Bearcat was shown on the 11-cent stamp.
