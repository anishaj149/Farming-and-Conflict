# Exploring the relationship between Agricultural Nitrogen Pollution and Regional Instability

Climate change is exacerbating conflict, and unsustainable agricultural practices exacerabates climate change. Can agricultural nitrogen pollution caused by be used as an indicator for regional instability? 

This project has three parts: 
1. Sentiment analysis to determine when conflict is occuring
2. Machine learning to train a neural network in the relationship between conflict and nitrogen pollution
3. Further analysis/regression models in MATLAB
